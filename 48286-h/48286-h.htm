<h2><a name="pagevii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
vii</span>PREFACE</h2>
<p><i>TO WAYFARING MEN</i>.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sirs</span>, the Holy Scriptures, which,
as we know, were written for our learning, seem to imply that
some of us are fools.</p>
<p>This may be so, and when I moralise, wrapped in the frequent
contemplation of my travels, upon lost opportunities, lack of
discernment, and on the general folly incident to all mankind,
but which each man deems centred in himself, I think so
too.&nbsp; But still a traveller in this travelling world, going
perhaps to nowhere, or to some place that he would rather never
visit, cannot but find his most congenial public amongst
wayfaring men.&nbsp; Therefore to you who, like myself, have
crossed, or even now are crossing, desert or pampa in the night;
riding towards Capella, if in the southern hemisphere (Sohail in
Africa), keeping the wind a little blowing on your right cheek,
dismounting now and then to smoke and slack the girths; then
camping on some river, sleeping fitfully and rising oft to view
your horses feeding so quietly under the southern stars; or you
who in the liner, ocean tramp, or even &ldquo;windjammer&rdquo;
are going somewhere for no special reason, I now address
myself.</p>
<p><a name="pageviii"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
viii</span>Writers, I take it, firstly write to please
themselves, if not, &rsquo;tis ten to one their writing pleases
nobody.&nbsp; Following my postulate I have set down that which
pleased me upon my pilgrimage, hoping that it may please at least
some two or three who, like myself, have wandered.&nbsp;
Therefore in this, my modest book of travels, I have tried to
write after the fashion that men speak over the fire at night,
their pipes alight, hands on their rifles, boots turned towards
the blaze, ears strained to catch the rustle of a leaf, and with
the tin tea mug stopped on its journey to the mouth when horses
snort; I mean I strove to write down that which I saw without
periphrasis, sans flag-wagging, and with no megrim in my head of
having been possessed by some great moral purpose, without which
few travellers nowadays presume to leave their homes.</p>
<p>I fear I have no theory of empires, destiny of the Anglo-Saxon
race, spread of the Christian faith, of trade extension, or of
hinterlands; no nostrum, by means of which I hope to turn Arabs
to Christians, reconcile Allah and Jahve, remove the ancient lack
of comprehension between East and West, mix oil and vinegar, or
fix the rainbow always in the sky so that the colour-blind may
scan it at their leisure through the medium of a piece of
neutral-tinted glass; and generally I fear I write of things
without a scrap of interest to right-thinking men: of humours,
sayings, proverbs, traits of character; little of eating, <a
name="pageix"></a><span class="pagenum">p. ix</span>drinking, or
night alarms of vermin, as travellers will; but, on the contrary,
of lonely rides, desolate camping places, of ruined buildings
seen in peculiar lights, of simple folk who pray to Allah seven
times a day, and act as if they never prayed at all; in fact of
things which to a traveller, his travels o&rsquo;er, still
conjure up the best part of all travel&mdash;its
melancholy.&nbsp; So I apologise for lack of analysis, neglect to
dive into the supposititious motives which influence but
ill-attested acts, and mostly for myself for having come before
the public with the history of a failure to accomplish what I
tried; and having brought together a sack of cobwebs, a pack of
gossamers, a bale of thistle-down, dragon-flies&rsquo; wings, of
Oriental gossip as to bygone facts, of old-world recollections,
of new-world practices half understood; lore about horses&rsquo;
colours, of tales of men who never bother much to think, but
chiefly act, carving their lives out, where still space is left
in which to carve, and acting thus so inconsiderately whilst
there still remain so many stones unbroken, social problems to be
solved, and the unpuncturable pneumatic tyre not yet found
out.</p>
<p>Touching my traveller&rsquo;s privilege I propose to use it
sparingly, but at the same time not to blurt out the brutal truth
too trippingly, for truth, I take it, suffers by too much
comprehension, in the same manner as the Mass has suffered even
by its transmutation into Elizabethan English.&nbsp; Religion,
once made <a name="pagex"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
x</span>understandable of all, loses its authenticity, and soon
degenerates into the arid dialectics of the self-righteous
Nonconformist.&nbsp; What so consoling to a religious man, as in
a building (with the entry free) to join in singing praises to an
unknown God, in an uncomprehended tongue?&nbsp; And so perhaps
the truth, <a name="citationx"></a><a href="#footnotex"
class="citation">[x]</a> declare it quite unblushingly, and it
may become as little interesting as is an ill-concocted lie.</p>
<p>It may be that my poor unphilosophic recollections of a
failure may interest some who, like myself, have failed, but
still may like to hear that even in a failure you can see strange
things, meet as strange types, and be impressed as much with wild
and simple folk, as any traveller who thundered through the land,
Bible and gun in hand, making himself no spiced conscience, but
putting into practice the best traditions of our race, confident
that the one way to win a &ldquo;nigger&rsquo;s&rdquo; heart
&ldquo;is to speak English to him,&rdquo; and doing so even at
the rifle&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
<p>But if they do not interest, then I fall back again upon my
wanderers, and hope that in my slight impressions they may find
something they recognise, something that they have felt before
upon the journey that they make across the Pampa of their lives,
making it as they do in general on horses hipshot, lean and
saddle-galled, asking their way from those they meet, who answer
them as wise as they, &ldquo;Ride on to the lone tree <a
name="pagexi"></a><span class="pagenum">p. xi</span>on the
horizon, then bear a little to the right, and if you keep the
line, you cannot miss the houses, for the barking of the dogs
will guide you, if it falls dark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then comes evening, and the travellers, still kicking at
their horses&rsquo; sides, straining their eyes, keep pushing
forward, stumbling and objurgating on the trail.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">R. B. CUNNINGHAME GRAHAM.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Gartmore</span>, 1898.</p>
<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>CHAPTER
I</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">South-south-west</span>, a little westerly
with a cloudy sky, and with long rollers setting into the harbour
of Tangier, and the date October 1st in the last year of
supposititious grace.&nbsp; The old white town, built round the
bay with the Kasbah upon its hill, and the mosque tower just
shining darkly against the electric light, for Tangier passed
from darkness to electric light, no gas or oil lamps intervening,
gave the effect as of a gleaming horse-shoe in the dark.&nbsp;
Outside the harbour, moored twice as far away as the French
ironclad, swung the <i>Rabat</i> at anchor, for the captain, a
Catalan of the true Reus breed, was bound to supplement his lack
of seamanship with extra caution.&nbsp; Towards her we made our
way late in the evening in a boat manned by four strong-backed
Jews, and seated silently, for it was the first stage of a
journey concerning which each of our friends had added his wisest
word of disencouragement.&nbsp; Nothing so spurs a man upon a
journey as the cautions of his friends, &ldquo;dangerous,&rdquo;
&ldquo;impossible,&rdquo; &ldquo;when you get there nothing worth
seeing,&rdquo; and the like, all show you plainly that the thing
is worth the venture, for you know the world is ever proud to
greet the conqueror with praise and flowers, but he has to
conquer first.&nbsp; And if he fails, the cautious kindly friend
wags his wise head and shakes his moralising finger, thinks <a
name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 2</span>you a fool,
says so behind your back, but cannot moralise away experience,
that chiefest recompense of every traveller.&nbsp; So in the boat
besides myself sat Hassan Suleiman Lutaif, a Syrian gentleman,
who acted as interpreter, and Haj Mohammed es Swani, a Moor of
the Riff pirate breed, short, strong, black-bearded, with a
turned-up moustache, and speaking Spanish after the Arab fashion,
that is without the particles, and substitution of the gerund for
every portion of the verb.&nbsp; El Haj and I were old
acquaintances, having made several journeys in Morocco, and being
well accustomed to each other&rsquo;s ways and idiosyncrasies
upon the road.</p>
<p>Our bourne was Tarudant, a city in the province of the Sus,
but rarely visited by Europeans, and of which no definite account
exists by any traveller of repute.&nbsp; Only some hundred and
fifty miles from Mogador, it yet continues almost untouched, the
only Moorish city to which an air of mystery clings, and it
remains the only place beyond the Atlas to the south in which the
Sultan has a vestige of authority. <a name="citation2"></a><a
href="#footnote2" class="citation">[2]</a></p>
<p>Outside its walls the tribesmen live the old Arab life, all
going armed, constantly fighting, each man&rsquo;s hand against
his neighbour, and, therefore, in a measure, raised against
himself.&nbsp; And yet a land of vines, of orange gardens, olive
yards, plantations of pomegranates, Roman remains, rich mines;
but cursed &ldquo;with too much powder,&rdquo; as the Arabs say,
and therefore doomed, up to the present day, to languish without
pauperism, prostitution, and the modern vices which, in more
favoured lands, have long replaced the old-world vices which man
brought with him into the old world.&nbsp; Even my friends were
all agreed that to reach Tarudant in European clothes <a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>was quite
impossible.&nbsp; Thus a disguise became imperative.&nbsp; After
a long discussion I determined to impersonate a Turkish doctor
travelling with his &ldquo;taleb&rdquo; <a
name="citation3a"></a><a href="#footnote3a"
class="citation">[3a]</a>&mdash;that is, scribe&mdash;to see the
world and write his travels in a book. <a
name="citation3b"></a><a href="#footnote3b"
class="citation">[3b]</a>&nbsp; God, the great doctor, but under
Him His earthly vicegerents, practicants, practitioners, with or
without diploma, throughout the east, enjoy considerable respect;
they kill, they cure, and still God has the praise.&nbsp; No one
asks where they studied, and if faith in his powers helps a
doctor in his trade, the east of all lands should be most
congenial to all those who live by lancet, purge, and human
faith.&nbsp; My stock of medicines was of the most homeric type,
quinine and mercury, some Seidlitz powders, eye wash for
ophthalmia, almost, in fact, as simple as that of the old Scotch
doctor who doctored with what he styled the two simples, that is,
laudanum and calomel.</p>
<p>The multitudinous dialects of Arabic, the constant travelling,
either upon the pilgrimage or for the love of travel, which seems
inherent in the Arab, render it possible for a European
occasionally to pass unrecognised, even although his stock of
Arabic is as exiguous as was my own.&nbsp; Behold us, then,
approaching the <i>Rabat</i>, a steamer of the Linea
Tras-Atlantica Espa&ntilde;ola, bound for Mogador, some five
days&rsquo; journey below Tangier, the point at which I intended
to put on Moorish clothes, buy mules and horses, engage a guide,
and set out for Tarudant, the city where La Caba, Count
Julian&rsquo;s daughter (she whose beauty tempted Don Rodrigo,
and to avenge whose <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>honour her father sold Spain to the Moors), lies buried,
though how she came to die there is to historians unknown.&nbsp;
On board the ship there was no light, no look-out, and the
accommodation ladder was triced up for the night, stewards were
asleep, and the long narrow vessel dipped her nose into the
rollers, rolling and heaving in the dark, whilst we in Spanish,
English, Arabic, and Portuguese rang all the changes upon ship
ahoy.&nbsp; At last a sulky, sleepy quartermaster deigned to let
down the ladder, and we scrambled upon deck.</p>
<p>Next morning found us off Arzila, the Julia Constantia Zilis
of the Romans, a small, walled town lost among orange gardens,
and girt by walls built by the Portuguese.&nbsp; Over the gateway
the half-obliterated arms of Portugal can still be seen, but
mouldering to decay, as is the country that they represent.&nbsp;
Close to the walls rises the tomb of the Saint of Arzila; the
white dome springs from a dense thicket of palmetto, dwarf
rhododendron, berberis, and aromatic shrubs, a tiny stream
bordered by oleanders (bitter as is an oleander is a proverb in
the land) runs past it; above the dome and red-tiled roof two
palms keep watch, and whisper in the wind the secrets palm trees
know, and tell each other of the East, and of the various
changes, Arab and Berber, Moor and Portuguese, they have seen
during the course of their slow growth and long extended
days.&nbsp; Columbus visited the place; the battle of Trafalgar
was fought a few leagues off, and an old shepherd, still living
where he was born, above the lighthouse on Cape Spartel,
remembers to have seen it as a boy when he lay out upon the hills
tending his goats.</p>
<p>Inside the town decay and ruin, heaps of garbage, a palace
falling here, a hovel there.&nbsp; A town almost entirely given
up to Jews, who carry on their business fleecing the Moors, and
still complaining when at last <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>the cent. per cented victim turns and
rends.&nbsp; The best-known citizen is Mr. Ben Chiton, an
Israelite of the best type, old, and white bearded, and with
round, beady eyes, like an old rat, consul of seven nations, with
all the seven flag-staffs on his hospitable roof.&nbsp; Dressed
in the Jewish gown girt round the waist, wearing his slippers
over white cotton stocking&rsquo;s, and the black cup badge of
the servitude of all his race throughout Morocco.&nbsp; His house
is neat and clean, almost beyond the power of endurance, Rahel
and Mordejai labouring incessantly with broom and whitewash
brush, and he himself talking incessantly in the Toledan <a
name="citation5"></a><a href="#footnote5"
class="citation">[5]</a> dialect and thick Jewish accent, of
politics, of kings, ambassadors, and as to whether England and
France will go to war over the question of the Niger and the
like, whilst all the time he presses brandy on you in a lordly
glass holding about a pint, which you must swallow no matter what
the hour, the while he calls upon the God of Isaac to bear him
witness that the house is yours, and shows you, with just pride,
the chair on which he says the Prince of Wales once sat, although
historians do not seem to chronicle his passage through the
town.&nbsp; An Israelite of Israelites, a worthy Jew, come of the
tribe of Judah as he says, one to whose house all travellers are
welcome; loved by his family with veneration, as the heads of
Jewish houses are.&nbsp; Long may he prosper, and may his roof
grow broad as a phylactery, and become strong enough to bear the
flag-staffs of all the nations upon earth, and his house long
remain to show the curious what most probably a Jewish house <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>in Spain was
like before the Catholic Kings, in their consuming thirst for
unity, expelled the Jews, sweeping at one fell blow commerce and
usury out of their sacred land, and setting up a faith so uniform
that to be saved by it was so easy that one wonders any one was
lost.&nbsp; A few hours&rsquo; steaming brings us to Larache (El
Areish), once a great stronghold of the Moorish pirates who
infested the narrow straits, and who at times ran as far north as
Plymouth, westward to Naples, and made the coasts of France,
Spain, Italy, and Portugal their especial hunting grounds.</p>
<p>Three of their galleys still lie rotting in the Luccos, and at
low tide their ribs can still be seen projecting from the
sand.&nbsp; The city, painted red, white, and blue, and the whole
scale of tints from brown to Naples yellow stands on a hill, and
is to-day the haunt of consuls of all nations, who have replaced
the pirates of the times gone by.&nbsp; Consuls of France and
Spain, of Portugal, of Montenegro, Muscat, Costa Rica, Brazil,
United States, their flag-staffs rear aloft from almost every
house-top, and their great flags, large in proportion to the
smallness of the state they represent, flap in the breeze; the
caps of liberty, the rising suns, and other trade-marks of the
various states seeming to wink and to encourage one another in
the attempt to be the first to show the glories of the commercial
system to the benighted Moors.&nbsp; All round the town the walls
and ramparts run, built by the Portuguese during the period when
they possessed the place.&nbsp; At the west side a ditch remains,
now turned into a garden, and in it artichokes, egg-plants, and
pimentos grow, and the green stuffs of various kinds for which
the Moors are famous, so much so that in the times they lived in
Spain, it was a current saying of a good farmer &ldquo;that he
grows as many egg-plants in his garden as a Morisco
gardener.&rdquo; <a name="citation6"></a><a href="#footnote6"
class="citation">[6]</a>&nbsp; Just at <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>the corner of the ditch the walls run
into as sharp an angle as the bows of a torpedo boat, and on the
ramparts usually is seen a colony of storks, who build their
nests amongst the mouldering gabions, ravelines, and
counter-scarps, and sit and chatter on the brass guns and
carronades, with curling snakes around the touch-holes, and with
inscription setting forth their date, the place of casting, and
the legend &ldquo;Viva Portugal!&rdquo;&nbsp; Their gunners are
long dead, their carriages long mouldered into dust, and the
storks left to sit and mock the pomps and circumstance of foolish
war.</p>
<p>From the town sallied out (in 1578) the army under Don
Sebastian, who met his fate fighting the infidel at Alcazar el
Kebir, near a long bridge over a marshy stream known as
Wad-el-Mhassen.&nbsp; The battle still is called amongst the
Moors &ldquo;The Three Kings&rsquo; Fight,&rdquo; for besides Don
Sebastian fell two Moorish kings.&nbsp; With Don Sebastian there
fell the flower of the nobility of Portugal, and by his death the
crown passed quickly to Phillip II. (the Prudent) of Spain, who
knew far better than to embark in expeditions into Africa.&nbsp;
The battle was memorable, for Abdel-Malik, King of Fez, died of
exhaustion on the field, and Don Sebastian, rather than survive
disgrace, plunged, as did Argentine at Bannockburn, into the
thickest of the fight, and fell or disappeared, for though his
faithful servant, Resende, claimed to have seen his body, so much
doubt existed of his death that the strange sect known as
Sebastianists arose in Portugal.&nbsp; Their tenet was that Don
Sebastian was still alive, but kept in durance by the Moors, and
in remote and old-world villages believers linger even to the
present day.&nbsp; I myself saw a sort of pterodactyle, years ago
in Portugal, a strange old man dressed in black clothes, and
wrapped, in heat and cold alike, in a thick cloak.&nbsp; The
people of the village called him <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>mad, but, looking at the thing
impartially, madness and faith are the same thing, the only
difference being as to the mountain which the believer wishes to
remove.</p>
<p>Lala Mamouna, the female saint who guards Larache from
pestilence and famine, sudden death, and the few simple ailments
which Arabs suffer from, has her white crenelated sanctuary on a
hill which overlooks the sea, and to her tomb women who wish for
children to carry on the misery of life, repair, and pray or
chatter with each other, and no doubt the saint is just as
tolerant of scandal as are the wise old men who sun their
stomachs at the windows of a club.</p>
<p>At this accursed port, Larache, of the Beni-Aros, after a
signal had been made by a man mounted on a mule, who held one end
of a row of flags, the other being made fast to a post, a great
annoyance fell upon the blameless captain of the good ship
<i>Rabat</i>.&nbsp; The bar at El Areish is three times out of
four impassable when steamers call, as here the river Luccos <a
name="citation8"></a><a href="#footnote8"
class="citation">[8]</a> meets the tide, and such a surf gets up
that as the people have no surf boats, communication from a
vessel to the shore is always dangerous, and not frequently
impossible.&nbsp; This, to an ordinary steamer, means either
delay or loss of cargo, generally the latter, for when the bar is
bad it often takes three or four days to become passable, and as
the anchorage is most precarious a south-east gale causes great
danger to a vessel lying in the open roads.&nbsp; On this
occasion, though, the sea was like a sheet of ice, smooth,
shining, and the bar just marked by a thin line of foam.&nbsp; To
the astonishment of the uninitiated passengers the fury of the
captain knew no bounds, the officers turned sulky, and the one
man on board who seemed unmoved was the unlucky priest, <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>who shipped to
please the owners of the line, or to appease the folly of the
nation, or for &ldquo;empe&ntilde;o,&rdquo; <a
name="citation9"></a><a href="#footnote9"
class="citation">[9]</a> or for some other reason at present not
made known, passed all his time in fishing when in port, or when
at sea in studying counterpoint, and playing on a piano which was
tuned about the time Queen Isabella was expelled from Spain.</p>
<p>A narrow, nine-knot crank and Clyde-built steamer was the
<i>Rabat</i>, full five-and-twenty years of age, boilers too
small, but engines sound, and the whole vessel kept as clean as
holystone and paint could clean, brass work all shining, and
herself ever a-rolling like a swing-boat at a fair, sailed out of
Barcelona, owned by the Spanish Trans-Atlantic Company (Chairman:
the Marquis of Comillas), and subsidised by the Spanish
Government to carry mails down the Morocco coast in order that
the majesty of Spain might fill the eyes and strike the
imagination of the Moorish dogs, and show them that the Spaniards
were on a level with the other nations, such as the Inglis,
Frances, el Bortokez (Portuguese), el Brus (the Germans, that is,
Prussians), and the Austrians, called by the Moors el
Nimperial.</p>
<p>Captain from Reus, taciturn, and shaved each Sunday when the
priest said mass, for it is decent for a man to stand before his
God with a clean chin, at other times a stubble on his face on
which a man might strike a match, so that the match had not been
made in Spain.&nbsp; Four officers: an Andalusian, two Catalans,
and a Basque; two engineers, and the aforementioned priest,
together with a crew of eighteen men and half a dozen stewards,
served to get the craft, whose utmost measurement could not be
above twelve hundred tons, across the sea.</p>
<p>The Pope had granted plenary indulgence in the <a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>following
terms: &ldquo;for looking to the circumstances, the weather,
etc., I deign to grant full dispensation according to the
ecclesiastic law, from fasting and from abstinence (from meat) to
all those who by reason, either of their profession or as
passengers, find themselves on board the vessels of this Company,
and that for three years&rsquo; time, excepting (if it can be
done without too great an inconvenience) on Good Friday and on
the Vigils of the Apostles, Saint Peter and Saint Paul, also on
Christmas Day and any other day which may be opportune . . . on
which three days I also dispense from sin the passengers and crew
if any difficulty unforeseen by me makes their compliance an
impossibility.&rdquo;&nbsp; Given &ldquo;en Vaticano&rdquo; and
through the Bishop of Madrid and Alcala under whose &aelig;gis it
appears that Spanish ships all sail armed with this plenary
indulgence; manned with the priest and men and duly subsidised,
it could not be expected that the <i>Rabat</i> cared much for
passengers, still less for cargo; so when the lumbering
&ldquo;barcazas&rdquo; approached the ship, curses loud,
guttural, and deep were heard on every side.&nbsp; The unwilling
sailors, mostly Valencians and Catalans, stood by to work the
donkey engine; but their fears were vain, for it appeared that
all the cargo was but four bales of Zatar (Marjoram) for the
Habana, and a few thousand melons for the Sultan&rsquo;s
camp.&nbsp; The bales of Zatar soon were dumped into the hold,
but five long hours were wasted passing the melons up from hand
to hand; in counting them, recounting them, in storming, and the
whole time a noise like Babel going on, shouting of Moors,
cursing of Spaniards, and the confusion ten times intensified
because no man could speak a word the other understood.&nbsp; The
<i>Rabat</i> having been only five years upon the coast, no one
on board could speak a word of Arabic.&nbsp; Why should they, did
they not speak Christian, and are Spaniards <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>and sailors
to be supposed to burrow in grammars as if they were schoolboys
or mere Englishmen.&nbsp; A miserable Jew, fearfully sea-sick,
balancing up in the gunwale of a boat, in a mixed jargon of
Arabic and Portuguese kept tale after a fashion, of the melons,
and at last the vessel put to sea amid the curses of the
passengers, and having earned the name amongst the Arabs of Abu
Batigh, the Father of the Melons.&nbsp; Amongst the Arabs almost
every man is Father of something or some quality, and lucky he
who does not find himself styled, Father of the &ldquo;ginger
beard,&rdquo; or of &ldquo;bad breath,&rdquo; or any other
personal or moral failing, peculiarity, or notable defect.</p>
<p>Once more we urge our nine-knot course, and now find time to
observe our fellow-passengers.&nbsp; In the cabin a German lady
and her daughters are enduring agonies of sea-sickness, on the
way to join her husband at Rabat. <a name="citation11"></a><a
href="#footnote11" class="citation">[11]</a> The husband, known
as the &ldquo;mojandis,&rdquo; that is, engineer to the Sultan,
proves, when we meet him, to be a cheery polyglot blasphemer,
charged with the erection of some forts at the entrance to the
harbour of Rabat.&nbsp; For a wonder the bar of the river
Bu-Regeh proves passable, and the German lady and her husband can
land, which is, it seems, a piece of luck, for the bar is known
as the most dangerous of all the coast.&nbsp; Rabat, perhaps the
most picturesquely situated of any city in Morocco, stands on a
hill underneath which the river runs, and the spray from the bar
is drifted occasionally into the houses like a shower of
snow.&nbsp; Here is the richest colony of the Spanish Jews, and
here the best <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>Morisco <a name="citation12a"></a><a href="#footnote12a"
class="citation">[12a]</a> families took refuge after the
expulsion of the Moors from Spain.&nbsp; The town is estimated to
contain some 20,000 inhabitants, and it is one of the four
official capitals; <a name="citation12b"></a><a
href="#footnote12b" class="citation">[12b]</a> the Sultan has a
palace with enormous gardens on the outskirts of the town.&nbsp;
Just opposite is built Salee, called by the Moors
&ldquo;Sal&aacute;,&rdquo; famous for having given its name to
the most enterprising of the pirates of the coast in days gone
by.&nbsp; To-day it is a little white, mouldering place, baked in
the fierce sun, or swept by south-west gales, according to the
season and the time of year.&nbsp; The inhabitants are still
renowned for their fanaticism, and the traveller who passes
through the place is seldom able to dismount, but traverses the
place trying to look as dignified as possible amid a shower of
curses, a sporadic curse or two, and some saliva if he ventures
within range of mouth.&nbsp; Many a poor Christian has worked his
life out in the construction of the walls, and the superior
whiteness of the inhabitants would seem to show that some of the
Christian dogs have left their blood amongst the people of the
place.&nbsp; Men still alive can tell of what a scourge the
pirates were, and I myself once knew a venerable lady who in her
youth had the distinction of having been taken by a Salee rover;
an honour in itself to be compared alone to that enjoyed by
ladies who are styled peeresses in their own right.&nbsp;
Robinson Crusoe, I think, once landed at the place, and the
voyages of imaginary travellers make a place more authentic than
the visit of the unsubstantial personages of real life.&nbsp; A
little up the river is the deserted city of Schellah, and on the
way to it, upon a promontory <a name="page13"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 13</span>jutting into the stream, is built the
half-finished tower of Hassan, an enormous structure much like
the Giralda at Seville, and by tradition said to be built by the
same architect who built that tower, and also built the tower of
the Kutubich, which, at Morocco city, serves as a landmark in the
great plain around.&nbsp; The Giralda and the Kutubich spring
from the level of the street, but the Hassan tower excels them
both in site, standing as it does upon a cliff, and
&ldquo;looming lofty&rdquo; <a name="citation13"></a><a
href="#footnote13" class="citation">[13]</a> as one passes in a
boat beneath.&nbsp; Schellah contains the tombs of the Sultans of
the Beni Merini dynasty.&nbsp; El Mansur (the victorious) sleeps
underneath a carved stone tomb, over which date palms rustle, and
by which a little stream sings a perpetual dirge.&nbsp; The tomb
is held so sacred that till but lately neither Christians nor
Jews could visit it.&nbsp; Even to-day the incursions of the
fierce Zimouri, a Berber tribe, render a visit at times
precarious.&nbsp; The walls of the town enclose a space of about
a mile circumference; sheep, goats, and camels feed inside them,
and a footpath leads from one deserted gate-house to the other, a
shepherd boy or two play on their reeds, and though the sun beats
fiercely on the open space, it looks forlorn and melancholy, and
even the green lizards peering from the walls look about timidly,
as if they feared to see a ghost.&nbsp; On gates and walls, on
ruined tombs and palaces, the lichens grow red after the fashion
of hot countries, and the fine stonework, resembling the stucco
work of the Alhambra, remains as keen in edge and execution as
when the last stroke of the chisel turned it out.&nbsp; Outside
the town are olive yards and orange gardens, and one comes upon
the long-deserted place with the same feelings as a traveller
sees Palenque burst on him out of the forests <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>of Yucatan,
or as in Paraguay after a weary following of dark forest trails,
the spires of some old Jesuit Mission suddenly appear in a green
clearing, as at Jesus or Trinidad, San Cosme Los Apostoles, or
any other of the ruined &ldquo;capillas,&rdquo; where the
bellbird calls amongst the trees, and the inhabitants take off
their hats at sunset and sink upon their knees, bearing in their
minds the teaching of the Jesuits, whom Charles III. expelled
from Spain and from the Indies, to show his liberalism.</p>
<p>Our most important passenger was Don Jose Miravent, the
Spanish Consul at Mogador, returning to his post after a holiday;
a formal Spaniard of the old school, pompous and kind, able to
bombast out a platitude with the air of a philosopher
communicating what he supposes truth.&nbsp; At dinner he would
square his elbows, and, throwing back his head, inform the world
&ldquo;the Kings of Portugal are now at Caldas&rdquo;; or if
asked about the war in Cuba, say: &ldquo;War, sir, there is none;
true some negroes in the Manigua <a name="citation14"></a><a
href="#footnote14" class="citation">[14]</a> are giving trouble
to our troops, but General Blanco is about to go, and all will
soon be over; it is really nothing (no es na), peace will, please
God, soon reign upon that lovely land.&rdquo;&nbsp; At night he
would sit talking to his cook, a Spanish woman (the widow of an
English soldier), whom he was taking back to Mogador; but though
he talked, and she replied for hours most volubly, not for a
moment were good manners set aside, nor did the cook presume in
any way, and throughout the conversation talked better than most
ladies; but the &ldquo;tertulia&rdquo; over, straight became a
cook again, brought him his tea, calling him &ldquo;Amo&rdquo;
(master), &ldquo;Don Jose,&rdquo; and he quite affably listened
to her opinions and ideas of things, which seemed at least as
valuable as were his own.&nbsp; A Jewish merchant dressed in the
height of Cadiz fashion, and <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>known as Tagir <a
name="citation15a"></a><a href="#footnote15a"
class="citation">[15a]</a> Isaac, occupied much the same sort of
social state on board as does a Eurasian in Calcutta or
Bombay.&nbsp; Tall, thin, and up-to-date, he had divested himself
almost entirely of the guttural Toledan accent, but the sign of
his &ldquo;election&rdquo; still remained about his hair, which
tended to come off in patches like an old hair trunk, and at the
ends showed knotty, as if he suffered from the disease to which
so many of his compatriots in Morocco are subject, and which
makes each separate hair stand out as if it were alive. <a
name="citation15b"></a><a href="#footnote15b"
class="citation">[15b]</a></p>
<p>But, as is often seen even in more ambitious vessels than the
<i>Rabat</i>, the passengers of greatest interest were in the
steerage.&nbsp; Not that there was a regular steerage as in
ocean-going ships, but still, some thirty people went as deck
passengers, and amongst them was to be seen a perfect microcosm
of the eastern world.&nbsp; Firstly a miserable, pale-faced
Frenchman, dressed in a dirty &ldquo;duster&rdquo; coat,
bed-ticking &ldquo;pants,&rdquo; black velvet waistcoat, and blue
velvet slippers, with foxes&rsquo; heads embroidered on them in
yellow beads, his beard trimmed to a point, in what is termed (I
think) Elizabethan fashion, and thin white hands, more
disagreeable in appearance than if they had been soiled by all
the meanest work on earth.&nbsp; His &ldquo;taifa&rdquo; <a
name="citation15c"></a><a href="#footnote15c"
class="citation">[15c]</a> (that is band) consisted of one
Spanish girl and two half-French half-Spanish women, whom he <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>referred to
as his &ldquo;company,&rdquo; and whom he said were to enact
&ldquo;cuadros vivos,&rdquo; that is &ldquo;living
pictures,&rdquo; in the various ports.&nbsp; They, less polite
than he, called him &ldquo;el Alcahuete,&rdquo; which word I
leave in Spanish, merely premising (as North Britons say) that it
is taken from the Arabic &ldquo;el Cahueit,&rdquo; and that the
celebrated &ldquo;Celestina&rdquo; <a name="citation16"></a><a
href="#footnote16" class="citation">[16]</a> was perhaps in
modern times the finest specimen of the profession in any
literature.&nbsp; So whilst our captain read &ldquo;Jack el
Ripero&rdquo; (it cost him two pesetas when new in Cadiz), I take
a glance at the inferior races, who were well represented in the
steerage of the ship.</p>
<p>Firstly, I came across a <i>confr&egrave;re</i> in the healing
art who hailed from Tunis, a fattish Arab dressed in Algerian
trousers, short zouave jacket, red fez, pink and white sash, and
watch chain of two carat silver with an imitation seal of glass,
brown thread stockings and cheap sand shoes after the pattern to
be seen at Margate.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tabib numero Wahed,&rdquo; that
is an A1 doctor, so he says, has studied in Stamboul, where he
remained nine years studying and diligently noting down all that
he learnt.&nbsp; But, curiously enough, all that he now remembers
of the Turkish language is the word &ldquo;Mashallah,&rdquo;
which he displayed to my bewilderment, until Lutaif, who spoke
good Turkish, turned on a flood of pertinent remarks, to which
the doctor answered in vile Tunisian Arabic, not having
understood a word.&nbsp; Though not a linguist, still a competent
practitioner, trepanning people&rsquo;s heads with ease, and
putting in pieces of gourd instead of silver as being lighter,
and if the patient died, or by the force of constitution lived
through his treatment, the praise was God&rsquo;s, Allah the
great Tabib (doctor), although he sends his delegates to practice
on mankind, just in the same way that in the east each man <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>commits his
work to some one else to do.&nbsp; At least he said so, and I
agree, but fail to see the use of substituting gourd for silver,
seeing the vast majority of heads are gourds from birth.&nbsp;
Quinine he had, and blistering fluid, with calomel and other
simples, and when the Christian quinine ran out, he made more for
himself out of the ashes of an oleander stick mixed with burnt
scales of fish and dead men&rsquo;s bones, and found his
preparation, which he styled &ldquo;El quina beladia&rdquo;
(native-made quinine), even more efficacious than the drug from
over sea.&nbsp; Also he used the seven herbs, known as the
&ldquo;confirmed herbs,&rdquo; for tertian fevers, with notable
success.&nbsp; A cheerful, not too superstitious son of
&AElig;sculapius, taking himself as seriously as if he had had a
large brass plate upon his door in Harley Street, and welcomed by
his surviving patients in Rabat on our arrival with great
enthusiasm. <a name="citation17a"></a><a href="#footnote17a"
class="citation">[17a]</a>&nbsp; His wife, a shrouded figure lost
in white veils and fleecy shawls, had the dejected air that
doctors&rsquo; wives often appear to labour under, even in
countries where they can rule their husbands openly.</p>
<p>A group of high-class Arabs sat by themselves upon the decks,
waited upon by a tall tribesman faced like a camel, and with the
handle of his pistol and curved dagger outlined beneath his
clothes.&nbsp; This group was composed of sherifs <a
name="citation17b"></a><a href="#footnote17b"
class="citation">[17b]</a> from Algeria, all high-caste men,
dignified, slow, and soft of speech, deliberate in movement,
their clothes as white as snow, nails dyed with henna, each with
a heavy rosary in his hand, their business somewhat mysterious,
but bound to see the Sultan in his camp.&nbsp; Throughout Algeria
the sherifs <a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>are not allowed to levy contributions from the people
openly, but it is said in private, they receive them all the
same.&nbsp; Of all the population they are the least contented
with French rule, as since the conquest naturally they have
fallen somewhat from the position they once occupied, and cannot
go about receiving presents for the pains they have taken to
preserve their lineage, as they do in Morocco, making themselves
a travelling offertory.</p>
<p>All of them wished to know of the late war between the Sultan
of Turkey and the &ldquo;Emperor of the Greeks.&rdquo;&nbsp; They
seemed to think the latter was a descendant of the
<i>Paleologi</i>, and asked if it were true the Sultan had killed
all the Greeks except fifteen, and if these latter had not fled
to &ldquo;Windres&rdquo; (London) to seek protection from the
Great Queen and to advise her to make preparations against the
&ldquo;Jehad&rdquo; <a name="citation18"></a><a
href="#footnote18" class="citation">[18]</a> to come.&nbsp; With
them they carried sundry hide bags of gold with which they said
they wished to purchase permission from the Sultan of Morocco to
export grain, as the harvest in Algeria had not been good owing
to locusts, and the lack of rain.&nbsp; Of course this may have
been the object of their visit, but since the Greco-Turkish war
all the Mohammedan world is on the stir, and men are travelling
about from place to place disseminating news, and all the talk is
on the victories of the Turks, and on the rising of the tribes in
India; in fact, a feeling seems to be abroad that the Christian
power is on the wane, and that their own religion once again may
triumph and prevail.</p>
<p>At Casa Blanca&mdash;called by the Arabs Dar el Baida, that
is, the White House&mdash;the sherifs go ashore, and I last saw
them seated on their bags, outside the waterport, their backs
against the ramparts of the town, their eyes apparently fixed
upon nothing <a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>though seeing everything, telling their beads and
waiting patiently, enduring sun and flies until their servant
should return and tell them of a lodging fit for persons of their
quality.&nbsp; Of all the towns on the Morocco coast Dar el Baida
has the most business, the country at the back of it is fertile
and grows much wheat, the tribes are fairly prosperous, and the
best horses of the country come from the districts known as Abda
and Dukala, a few leagues from the place.</p>
<p>Consuls abound, of course, so do hyenas&mdash;that is, outside
the town&mdash;but both are harmless and furnish little sport,
except the Consul of America, my good friend Captain Cobb.&nbsp;
He, if my memory fails me not, piled up his brig some thirty
years ago upon the beach in the vicinity, liked the climate,
became a Consul, naturally, and to this day has never returned to
his sorrowing family in Portland, Maine.</p>
<p>In thirty years tradition says he has not learned a word of
Arabic with the exception of the word &ldquo;Balak&rdquo; (look
out), which he pronounces &ldquo;Balaaker,&rdquo; and yet holds
conversations by the hour in Arabic, and both the patients seem
contented with their lot.&nbsp; All the attractions to be met
with in the town do not detain me; what takes my fancy most is to
see tribesmen from the country, armed to the teeth, and balancing
a gun full six feet long upon their saddles, sit on their horses
bargaining at shops in the same fashion I have seen the Gauchos
at a camp-town in South America, their horses nodding their heads
and looking half asleep, their owners seated with one leg passed
round the pommel of the saddle, and passing hours seated as
comfortably as in a chair.</p>
<p>Back to the steamer in a boat, and at the waterport we pass a
group of Jews washing themselves, in preparation for a
feast.&nbsp; Lutaif ranks as a wit for saying that the Jews will
defile the sea, for any wit is small enough to bait a Jew with;
and the Arabs, though <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>they will say the same things of a
Christian behind his back, all laugh consumedly when a Christian
takes their side against a Jew.</p>
<p>On board the uneasy ship, tossing like a buck-jumper in the
Atlantic swell, we find more Oriental items ready to hand.&nbsp;
The first a tall, thin, cuckoldy-looking Arab knave, dressed in a
suit of slop-made European clothes, his trousers half-a-foot too
short, his boots unblacked, and himself closely watched by two
Franciscan Friars. <a name="citation20a"></a><a
href="#footnote20a" class="citation">[20a]</a>&nbsp; It appeared
he was a convert.&nbsp; Now, in Morocco a convert is a most rare
and curious animal, and he is usually not a great credit to his
capturers.&nbsp; On this occasion, it appears, the convert had
been dallying with the Protestants, had given them hopes, had led
them on, and at the last, perhaps because he found the
North-British water <a name="citation20b"></a><a
href="#footnote20b" class="citation">[20b]</a> of their baptism
too cold for him, or perchance because the Friars gave a dollar
more, had fallen away to Rome.&nbsp; However, there he was, a
veritable &ldquo;brand,&rdquo; a sheep, who had come into one of
the folds, leaving the other seven million nine hundred and
ninety-nine thousand and ninety-nine still straying about
Morocco, steeped in the errors of Mohammedanism.&nbsp; His
captors were a gentlemanlike, extremely <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>handsome,
quiet Castilian, who to speak silver (hablar en plata) seemed a
little diffident about his prize, and went about after the
fashion of a boy in Texas who has caught a skunk.&nbsp; The other
guardian had no doubts.&nbsp; He was a sturdy Catalonian
lay-brother, who pointed to the &ldquo;brand&rdquo; with pride,
and told us, with a phrase verging upon an oath, that he was glad
the Protestants had had their noses well put out of joint.&nbsp;
The victim was a merry sort of knave, who chewed tobacco, spoke
almost every language in the world, had travelled, and informed
me, when I asked him where he was going, that the
&ldquo;Frayliehs&rdquo; (Friars) were taking him to Cadiz
&ldquo;to have the water put upon his head.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
seemed an old hand at the business, and recognised my follower,
Swani, as a friend, and they retired to talk things over, with
the result that, e&rsquo;er night fell, the &ldquo;convert&rdquo;
was in a most unseemly state and singing Spanish songs in which
Dolores, Mercedillas, and other &ldquo;Chicas&rdquo; figured
largely, and were addressed in terms sufficient to upset a
convent of Franciscan Friars.&nbsp; Peace to his baptism, and may
the Protestants, when their turn comes to mark a sheep, secure as
fine a specimen as the one I saw going to Cadiz to have
&ldquo;the water put upon his head.&rdquo;&nbsp; This missionary
question and the decoying of God-fearing men out of the ranks of
the religion they were born in, is most thorny in every country
like Morocco, where the religion of the land is one to which the
people are attached.&nbsp; An earnest missionary, a pious
publican, a minister of the crown who never told a lie, are men
to praise God for, continually.&nbsp; Honour to all of them,
labouring in their vocations and striving after truth as it
appears to them.&nbsp; I, for my part, have found honest and
earnest men both in the Scottish missions in Morocco and in the
ranks of the Franciscan Friars from Spain.&nbsp; Amongst both
classes, and in the missions sent by <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>other churches, good men abound; and
in so far as these good men confine themselves to giving
medicines, healing the sick, and showing by the example of their
lives that even Christians (whom Arabs all believe are influenced
in all they do by money) can live pure, self-denying lives for an
idea, the good they do is great; but that by living, as they do,
amongst the Moors, they do more good than they could do at home
by living the same lives, that I deny.&nbsp; Amongst Mohammedans
plenty of people lead good lives, as good appears to
them&mdash;that is, they follow out the precepts of their faith,
give to the poor, do not lend money upon usury; and, to be brief,
practice morality, <a name="citation22"></a><a href="#footnote22"
class="citation">[22]</a> and believe by doing so that they are
sacrificing to some fetish, invented by mankind, to make men
miserable.&nbsp; When, though, it comes to marking
sheep&mdash;the object, after all, for which a missionary is
sent&mdash;I never saw a statement of accounts which brought the
balance out upon the credit side.&nbsp; The excuse is, generally,
&ldquo;Oh, give us time; these things work
slowly;&rdquo;&mdash;as indeed they do; and if the missions think
it worth their while to send men out to doctor syphilis, cure
gonorrhoea, and to attend to every form of the venereal disease,
their field is wide; but if they wish to convert Mohammedans let
them produce a balance-sheet, and show how many of the infidel
they have converted in the last twenty years.&nbsp; Not that I
blame them for endeavouring to perform what seems impossible, or
try to detract an atom from the praise due to them for their
efforts, but when so many savages still exist in Central Africa
and in East London&mdash;not to speak of Glasgow and the
like&mdash;it seems a pity to expend upon a people, civilised
according to their needs, so much good faith, which might be used
with good effect upon less stony ground.</p>
<p><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>Prophets, reformers, missionaries,
&ldquo;illuminated&rdquo; folk, and those who leave their homes
to preach a faith, no matter what it is, are people set apart
from the flat-footed ordinary race of human kind; of such are
missionaries and the dream world they live in.&nbsp; How many an
honest, hard-working young man, who gets his education how he
can, by pinching, screwing, reading at bookstalls, paying for
instruction to those who live perhaps almost as poorly as he
himself, thinks when he reads of Livingstone, Francisco Xavier,
the Jesuits of Paraguay, and Father Damien, that he, too, would
like to take his cross upon his back and follow them.&nbsp; It
seems so fine (and is so splendid in reality) a self-denying
life, lived far away from comforts, without books; Bible and gun
in hand, to show the heathen all the glories of our faith.</p>
<p>Then comes reality, mocker of all best impulses, and the
enthusiastic spirit finds itself bound in a surgery (say in
Morocco city), finds work increasing, and his dreams of preaching
to a crowd of dusky catechumens dressed in white, with flowers in
their hair, and innocence in every heart, turned to Dead Sea
Fruit, as with motives misunderstood, with caustic, mercury,
sulphate of copper and the rest, he burns the fetid ulcer, or
washes sores, and for reward can say after a term of years that
he has made the people of the place look upon European clothes
with less aversion than when first he came.</p>
<p>If the mere fact of getting accustomed to the sight of
Europeans were a thing worthy of self-congratulation, then indeed
missionaries in Morocco have achieved much.&nbsp; But as I see
the matter Europeans are a curse throughout the East.&nbsp; What
do they bring worth bringing, as a general rule?</p>
<p>Guns, gin, powder, and shoddy cloths, dishonest dealing only
too frequently, and flimsy manufactures which displace the
fabrics woven by the women; new <a name="page24"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 24</span>wants, new ways, and discontent with
what they know, and no attempt to teach a proper comprehension of
what they introduce; these are the blessings Europeans take to
Eastern lands.&nbsp; Example certainly they do set, for ask a
native what he thinks of us, and if he has the chance to answer
without fear, &rsquo;tis ten to one he says, Christian and cheat
are terms synonymous.&nbsp; Who that has lived in Arab countries,
and does not know that fear, and fear alone, makes the position
of the Christian tolerable.&nbsp; Christ and Mohammed never will
be friends; their teaching, lives, and the conditions of the
different peoples amongst whom they preached make it impossible;
even the truce they keep is from the teeth outwards, and their
respective followers misunderstand each other quite as thoroughly
as when a thousand years ago they came across each other&rsquo;s
path for the first time.&nbsp; But if the Arabs constitute a
stony vineyard, the Jews are worse, and years ago when first the
missionaries appeared in the coast towns of southern Barbary,
they fleshed their maiden weapons on the Jews.&nbsp; It struck
the chosen people that the best weapon to employ against their
new tormentors was that of irony, and so they cast about to find
a nickname calculated at the same time to ridicule and wound, and
found it, made it stick and rankle, so that to-day every new
missionary on landing has to accommodate his shoulders to the
burden of a peculiarly comic cross.</p>
<p>Almost all Europeans in Morocco must of necessity be
merchants, if not they must be consuls, for there is hardly any
other industry open to them to choose.&nbsp; The missionaries
bought and sold nothing, they were not consuls; still they ate
and drank, lived in good houses, and though not rich, yet passed
their lives in what the Jews called luxury.&nbsp; So they agreed
to call them followers of Epicurus, for, as they said,
&ldquo;this Epicurus was a devil who did naught but eat and <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>drink.&rdquo;&nbsp; The nickname stuck, and changed into
&ldquo;Bikouros&rdquo; by the Moors, who thought it was a title
of respect, became the name throughout Morocco for a
missionary.&nbsp; One asks as naturally for the house of Epicurus
on coming to a town as one asks for the &ldquo;Chequers&rdquo; or
the &ldquo;Bells&rdquo; in rural England.&nbsp; Are you
&ldquo;Bikouros&rdquo;? says a Moor, and thinks he does you
honour by the inquiry; but the recipients of the name are fit to
burst when they reflect on their laborious days spent in the
surgery, their sowing seed upon the marble quarries of the
people&rsquo;s hearts, and that the Jews in their malignity
should charge upon them by this cursed name, that they live in
Morocco to escape hard work, and pass their time in eating and in
quaffing healths a thousand fathoms deep.</p>
<p>Often at night, awake and looking at the stars and trying to
remember which was which, I have broken into laughter when I
thought upon the name, and laughed until the Arabs all sat up
alarmed, for he who laughs at night laughs at his hidden
wickedness, or else because a devil has possessed his soul.</p>
<p>Cargo, of course, was not expected in the <i>Rabat</i>, and as
by four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon the last few passengers
had come aboard, it might have been expected that the ship would
put to sea.&nbsp; Not so, the captain gave it as his opinion that
it was best to wait till midnight so as to arrive in Mazagan by
breakfast time; so for eight hours we waited in sight of Casa
Blanca, swinging up and down, giddy and miserable, and in the
intervals of misery tried to fish.</p>
<p>Next morning we were off Djedida (New Town), as the Arabs call
Mazagan.&nbsp; A yellowish town, peopled by Jews, Moors, and
innumerable yellow dogs.&nbsp; Camels blocked all the streets,
and above the consul&rsquo;s flag-staffs a single palm-tree
reared its head, fluttering its feathers over the sandstone walls
built by the Portuguese in the days when they were navigators, <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>adventurers,
and over-ran the world, after the fashion of the modern
Englishman.&nbsp; The batteries built by the Moors or by the
Portuguese are most ingeniously constructed to expose the
gunners, and to batter down the town they are supposed to
guard.&nbsp; Outside a street of beehive-looking huts of reeds,
each with its little garden, its ten or twelve dogs, thirteen or
fourteen children, three or four donkeys, and a score of mangy
fowls, and with a bush or two of castor oil plants sticking up in
the sand at every corner of the street, gives quite an air of
equatorial Africa or Paraguay.</p>
<p>Right in the middle of the Plaza a squadron of some fifty Arab
irregular soldiers guard about two hundred prisoners.&nbsp; These
latter, heavily ironed and half-starved, were of the tribe of the
Rahamna, who for the past twelve months had been in open
rebellion against their liege lord the Sultan, Abdul Aziz, whom
may God defend.&nbsp; The system in Morocco when a Sultan dies is
for the tribes who think they may be strong enough, to refuse to
pay all taxes, and then the Sultan is obliged to come in person
with an army to discuss the matter, to fight, and if he wins send
baskets full of heads to be stuck up on the chief cities&rsquo;
gates, and squads of prisoners like the band I saw in Mazagan to
rot in prison till death relieves them of their miserable
lives.&nbsp; Every one of the prisoners in the Plaza must have
known that any chance of his release was small, indeed, they knew
they were going to be half-starved, either in a dark cellar-like
prison, or in an open courtyard exposed to sun and cold, for the
Morocco Government allows no rations to its prisoners, and those
who have no friends soon die of hunger. <a
name="citation26"></a><a href="#footnote26"
class="citation">[26]</a>&nbsp; Still they were not apparently
much <a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>put
about.&nbsp; People stood talking to them, flies settled on their
eyelids, dogs licked their sores, horses and camels jostled
against them, the sun poured on their heads, and still they did
not suffer in the way our prisoners suffer, for they were not cut
off in sentiment from those, their brothers in Mohammed, who
stood round and talked to them to pass the time.&nbsp; Pious old
ladies, young philanthropists and novelists in search of
&ldquo;copy&rdquo; who visit Tangier go into
&ldquo;visibilio,&rdquo; as the Italians say, over the prisoners
in the prison, with its flat horseshoe arches at the door, so
similar in style to those at Toledo in the old synagogue, now
turned into a church. <a name="citation27"></a><a
href="#footnote27" class="citation">[27]</a></p>
<p>All those good people and each journalist, all have their word
about the darkness, chains, and the want of air; the misery, the
crowding at the door to take the chocolate (which should have
been tobacco) which the pious lady brings.&nbsp; Each tourist
sends home his badly written paragraph to his favourite paper,
and goes away lamenting over the barbarism of Mohammedans; and,
if he is a &ldquo;glorious empire&rdquo; man, thinks of the time
when, under the Union Jack, the Moorish prisoner shall have a
number and a cell, tin pan to wash in, Bible to read, and all
shall be apparelled in Queen Victoria&rsquo;s livery, until they
purge themselves of their contempt and promise to amend their
naughty lives.</p>
<p>One thing they all forget when writing of a Moorish prison,
that, in spite of dirt, of chains, of want of air, of herding all
together in a den, they are happier than prisoners with us, for
they can speak, exhale their misery in conversation; they still
are men, and leave the prison men, instead of devils, hating all
mankind like those who, under our inhuman silent plan, eat out
their miserable &ldquo;terms&rdquo; cursing the fools who in
their foolish kindness hit on a device <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>to turn men into stone. <a
name="citation28"></a><a href="#footnote28"
class="citation">[28]</a>&nbsp; And so I leave the prisoners in
the square, thinking as an old Arab says: &ldquo;It looks as if
the Sultan wished to finish with all the Mussulmen.&rdquo;&nbsp;
At any rate, since the last Sultan&rsquo;s death, three years
ago, thousands must have been killed in war, died by starvation,
or rotted miserably to death in prisons underneath the
ground.</p>
<p>It being a feast day of the Jews all stores were closed in
Mazagan, for in Morocco all the retail business is in Jews&rsquo;
hands, and no religion that I know of seems to have so many days
on which men may not work; and therefore it is strange that men
have not yet flocked to join their faith.</p>
<p>At last the steamer shakes itself free from the allurements of
Mazagan and steers almost due west to clear the reef, which,
jutting out about six miles, makes Mazagan the least exposed of
all the open harbours on the coast.&nbsp; As Mazagan is distant
only three days from the city of Morocco it may be destined some
day to a glorious commercial future, with railways, docks, smoke,
pauperism, prostitution in the streets, twenty-five faiths
instead of one, drunkards, cabs, bicycles and all our vices, so
different in their nature from those the Arabs brought from
Arabia and have clung to in the same way they cling to their
religion, dress, speech, their alphabet, and their peculiar mode
of life.</p>
<p>As we steamed out, the town of Azimur was seen under our lee,
about twelve miles from Mazagan, situated on a hill close to the
river Um er R&rsquo;bieh, once an important harbour but long
silted up by sand.&nbsp; The harbour, once the resort of pirates,
is now silted up, and the remembrance of the pirates&rsquo; deeds
is still <a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>kept fresh in people&rsquo;s memories by a great store
of old Delft plates, either taken by pirates in the merry days
gone by, or sent from Holland <a name="citation29a"></a><a
href="#footnote29a" class="citation">[29a]</a> in the times when
vessels from the Dutch ports traded along the coast.&nbsp; To-day
the foreign merchants buy them or exchange them for modern china,
and their inglorious end is to hang on a wall beside the
so-called artistic plenishings of ladies&rsquo; over-gimcracked
drawing-rooms.</p>
<p>As we turn southwards, after clearing the long reef, it seems
as if we had already entered another zone.&nbsp; The hills along
the beach become more arid, the plains all stony or covered with
low, thorny scrub.&nbsp; Saffi, the hottest place on all the
coast, melts past, merely a film of white against the reddish
background, and in the distance the foot-hills rising to the
Atlas now appear.&nbsp; The largest of them Jebel Hadid, the
Mount of Iron standing out like an enormous box <a
name="citation29b"></a><a href="#footnote29b"
class="citation">[29b]</a> above the coast.</p>
<p>A Yemeni Jew has come on board, bound for Mogador, the city of
the Jews.&nbsp; Short, black-eyed, greasy-locked, and with a red
fez bound round with a woman&rsquo;s shawl, he, like St. Paul, is
of a mean appearance.&nbsp; Still he has much to tell about
Arabia, and the province from which he comes.&nbsp; It appears
that near Sannaar, in South Arabia, there is a land called
Beni-Mousa.&nbsp; In this favoured spot the inhabitants are all
Jews, and none of them are known to speak untruths, at least so
says their representative on board the ship.&nbsp; This tribe, he
says, is that of Shebatat.&nbsp; A river, which bounds their
country, has so fierce a current that rocks and stones are moved
along by it, and no mere Gentile can cross the stream.&nbsp; Upon
its banks <a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>grow two tall trees (Sandaracs, he thinks), which bend
across to one another and salute by saying, &ldquo;Shabat
Sholom.&rdquo;&nbsp; On Saturday they do not bend over to one
another, and keep no watch; therefore, on Saturday alone can
Gentiles cross the wondrous river, as on that day only does the
stream abate its force.&nbsp; All this is true, and I myself am
much confirmed in my opinion of its truth, because at night this
same veracious Jew produced out of a bag a bottle of spirit
(majia) made from dates, and, drinking it, got most uproarious,
shouting and singing, falling repeatedly upon the winch to the
great delight of all the Moors, and towards midnight avowing his
intention of swimming back to the Yemen so that my henchman Haj
Mohammed es Swani, who had been a sailor, had to make him fast to
a ringbolt in the deck.&nbsp; And as in Arabic without a particle
after the fashion of a child or negro, I tried to express my
astonishment at such a line of conduct in so grave a man, to a
young Arab who stood near me, without a smile he answered, in
most perfect English, &ldquo;I am not certain if I understand all
that you say, sir, but I speak English pretty well.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In outward visible appearance he was an Arab of the usual kind,
bare legs and yellow slippers, shaved head and fez with rather
grimy turban, dirty white drawers, and brown djellaba <a
name="citation30a"></a><a href="#footnote30a"
class="citation">[30a]</a> with the hood of it over his head
after the fashion of a friar.&nbsp; It seemed he was an acrobat
from the province of the Sus, from the celebrated Zowia <a
name="citation30b"></a><a href="#footnote30b"
class="citation">[30b]</a> of Si Hamed O&rsquo;Musa, the patron
saint of all the acrobats throughout Morocco.&nbsp; Not far from
the Wad <a name="citation30c"></a><a href="#footnote30c"
class="citation">[30c]</a> Nun is situate the district <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>called
Taseruelt, and in that district the famous patron saint of
acrobats is buried at the above named Zowia.&nbsp; From thence a
large proportion of the Arab troops of acrobats, who perform at
our music-halls, set forth to tumble round the world.</p>
<p>My English speaking acrobat had terminated an engagement at
the South London Music Hall, and was returning to resteep himself
in the true faith at home, and also, it is possible, to
rest.&nbsp; He told me that his ambition was to marry a European
girl, and that his choice would be a German, for he said,
&ldquo;German girls mind the house and sew; English are prettier,
but will not sew, and, besides that, they are always drinking
plenty.&rdquo;&nbsp; Out of the mouths of babes and heathens I
think a reflection on our national femininity comes with some
force.&nbsp; As we stand talking of the &ldquo;Empire,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Pavilion,&rdquo; &ldquo;Oxford&rdquo; and other
&ldquo;halls,&rdquo; both in the provinces and the metropolis,
the island which half shelters the roadstead of Mogador came into
view.</p>
<p>Kissed by the north-east trade which just envelops Mogador and
about half a league of country outside the town, the city,
dazzlingly white, lies in the sun, well meriting the name of
Sueira, that is, the picture, given by the Moors.&nbsp; Founded
in 1760, by order of the Sultan Sidi Mohammed, the plan made by
an engineer from France, whose name, according to the Arabs, was
Cornut, the city (supposed by some to be the ancient
Erythr&aelig;a) is the most regularly built and most commercial
of all the empire.&nbsp; A little desert, varying in breadth from
three to thirteen miles, cuts off the city from the fertile
lands.&nbsp; Sand, and more sand, fine, white, and almost always
altering in position, gives an idea of the Sahara made in
miniature.&nbsp; The little river Wad el Ghoreb runs near the
town, and in the middle of the water a former Sultan has built a
palace founded on the sand; but though <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>the north-east trade blows almost all
the year, and when it rains the rain comes down in torrents, the
palace has not fallen, and, as it never was inhabited, it remains
a monument of human folly, surmounting all the powers of
providence.&nbsp; Jews, Jews, and still more Jews possess the
place; they make their Kidush, keep their Purim, Caba&ntilde;as,
and New Year; eat adafina, broaden their business and
phylacteries, are hospitable, domestic in their habits, each man
revered in his own house as if he were a prophet, and all the
business of the place is in their hands.</p>
<p>Grave, reserved Jews in gabardines, smart up-to-date young
Jews in white straw hats and European clothes, daughters of
Israel with handkerchiefs bound round their heads and hanging
down their backs, others in Paris fashions, but all with hair
like horses&rsquo; tails, are everywhere.&nbsp; Donah and Zorah,
Renia, Estrella, Rahel, and Zulica, with Azar, Slimo, Baruch, and
Mordejai are seen in every street; they sit in shops, lean out of
windows, lounge upon the beach, walk about slowly as if they
stepped on eggs, are kind in private life, cruel in business;
they keep up much communication with Houndsditch, Hamburg,
Amsterdam, Jerusalem, and other centres of the
&ldquo;community,&rdquo; speaking an Arabic garnished with
English, seasoned with Spanish, peppered with Shillah <a
name="citation32"></a><a href="#footnote32"
class="citation">[32]</a> words, and rendered as intelligible as
Chinook by the thick utterance with which they speak.&nbsp; An
amiable race, business once over, and charitable amongst
themselves; what is called moral, that is, their customs do not
tolerate prostitution, and husbands love their wives, children
their parents, and their home life resembles that which writers
say is to be seen in England, but which <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>experience
generally shows is oftener found in France, where families go out
together and men are not ashamed to play with children, and to
sit drinking coffee out of doors beside their grandmothers.</p>
<p>So to this New Jerusalem, after a five days&rsquo; voyage, the
<i>Rabat</i> arrived, and anchored inside the island where the
Sultan has a great open prison; there his rebels are confined,
and daily die, both those who live and those whom death
releases.&nbsp; An iron steamboat, much like a tramp, in shape,
but armed with four small guns, and commanded by a German
officer, displays the red flag of Morocco, identical in colour
with the well-known flag which in Hyde Park has braved a thousand
meetings, and around which the &ldquo;comrades&rdquo; flock to
listen when Quelch holds forth on social wrongs, or Mr. Hyndman
speaks on India, and outside the crowd the bourgeois feels a
shrinking in the stomach as he smooths his hat to give him
countenance.&nbsp; We bid the microcosmic craft good-bye, and go
ashore stuffed in a boat with Moors and Jews, some Spaniards, two
Franciscan friars, eight or ten bird-cages, and land to find the
Jewish feast proceeding, the hotels all full, the shops all shut,
and the whole town delivered over to the mercies of Jehovah, who,
caring little for a mere Christian, left us to walk the baking
street four mortal hours, till just when we were going to buy a
tent to sleep in, Lutaif remembered that he had a dear and valued
friend who lived in Mogador.&nbsp; Comment upon his memory seemed
injudicious.&nbsp; His friend, Mr. Zerbib, a missionary, received
us into his hospitable house.&nbsp; We straight forgot our
troubles and the Jews&rsquo; unseasonable feast, and fell
discussing with our host whether or not the thing in Europe known
as progress had proved a blessing or a curse, sporadically
introduced into Morocco by the waifs and strays, the tourists,
traders, runaway sailors, and the rest who, on the coast, act as
the vanguard of the army of the light.</p>
<h2><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>CHAPTER II.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">All</span> Mogador we found much exercised
about the province of the Sus, the very province in which the
inaccessible Tarudant, the city of our dreams, was
situated.&nbsp; It seemed that about eighteen months ago, one
Abdul Kerim Bey, an Austrian subject, had arrived and hoisted his
flag as Patagonian consul.&nbsp; Brazil and Portugal, Andorra,
San Marino, Guatemala, Hayti, and San Domingo, Siam, the Sandwich
Islands, Kotei, Acheen, the Transvaal, Orange Free State, and
almost every place where there was revenue sufficient to buy a
flag and issue postage stamps for philatelists, had long ago sent
consuls to Mogador.&nbsp; Their flag-staffs reared aloft looked
like a mighty canebrake, from the sea; their banners shaded the
streets after the fashion of the covering which the Romans drew
over their amphitheatres, and half the population were consuls of
some semi-bankrupt state.&nbsp; Yet Patagonia, even in Mogador,
excited some surprise.&nbsp; Jews who had been in Buenos Ayres
(and a considerable quantity emigrate thence from Mogador) argued
that Patagonia was under the authority of the Argentine
Republic.&nbsp; Those who had been in Valparaiso said it belonged
to Chile.&nbsp; Few knew where Patagonia really was.&nbsp; The
Arabs, whose geography is fragmentary, thought
&ldquo;Batagonia&rdquo; was situated somewhere in Franguestan,
and that contented them.&nbsp; What struck their fancy most was
certainly the colour and design of the new oriflamme.&nbsp;
Barred white and blue, a rising <a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>sun grinning across three mountain
tops, a cap of liberty, and a huanaco ruminant; an Araucanian
Indian in his war paint in one corner, and here and there stars,
daggers, scales, and other democratic trade-marks, made up a
banner the like of which had seldom been observed in all the much
be-bannered town of Mogador.&nbsp; The owner of this standard and
the defender in Morocco of the lives and liberties of Patagonian
subjects, dressed like a Turk (long single-breasted black frock
coat and fez), and spoke a little Turkish, but no Arabic.&nbsp;
His age was that of all the world, that is, somewhere between
twenty-eight and fifty, and his appearance insignificant, all but
his eyes, which some declared to have the power of seeing through
a brick, and others that of piercing through cloth and leather,
and discerning gold from silver in the recesses of a purse.&nbsp;
Be all that as it may, a travelled man, a doctor; that is,
&ldquo;tabib,&rdquo; for the two words, though given in
dictionaries as the Arabic and English for the equivalents of the
same thing in either tongue, in point of fact, are
different.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tabib,&rdquo; in Oriental lands, is a
convenient travelling designation, as &ldquo;Colonel&rdquo; in
the Southern States, and as &ldquo;Captain&rdquo; was in Georgian
times; it rather indicates a status than a profession, and, in
addition, is not out of place upon a traveller&rsquo;s card.</p>
<p>Dr. el Haj Abdul Kerim apparently enjoyed his designation and
his &ldquo;tabibship&rdquo; by the grace of God.&nbsp; His
consulate he held by virtue of a mandate of an extraordinary
potentate.</p>
<p>Some two-and-twenty years ago, a Frenchman, one Aureille de
Tounens, a man of family and an advocate of Bordeaux, succeeded
in persuading the Indians of Arauco that he was their king.&nbsp;
This soon aroused the anxiety both of the Chilians and the
Argentines; for from the time when first Ercilla <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>wrote his
&ldquo;Araucana,&rdquo; the Indians of Araucania had been free,
and if they had had a king perhaps they would have taught the
neighbouring Republics what liberty really meant.&nbsp; For a
brief space De Tounens flourished under the style and title of
&ldquo;Aurelio Primero, rey de los Araucanos,&rdquo; and then
diplomacy or treachery, or both, ousted him, and he died
&ldquo;i&rsquo; the spital&rdquo; in his own town of
Bordeaux.&nbsp; During his efflorescence he coined money,
designed a flag, gave titles of nobility, and appointed consuls;
and it appears that one of them was this Kerim Bey, the
Turco-Austrian, who swooped upon Mogador, out-consuling all
consuls hitherto known by the size and pattern of his flag.&nbsp;
It is not likely that Aurelio Primero ever heard of Mogador,
still less that from Arauco he sent a special envoy to such a
place.&nbsp; Most probably he sent out consuls generally, after
the fashion of bishops <i>in partibus</i>, with a roving
consulship, and with instructions to set up their flags wherever
they found three or four dozen fools assembled and a sufficient
roof to bear the pole.</p>
<p>One of these roving consular commissions no doubt was given to
Dr. Abdul Kerim Bey, in days gone by, in South America.&nbsp;
Indeed, I fancy I remember at Bahia Blanca a forlorn Austrian who
was said to have held some illusory employment about the person
of the Araucanian King, such as head bottle-washer, holder of the
royal stirrup, or guardian of the royal purse, the last, of
course, a sinecure which, in all courts that have no money,
should be abolished in the interest of economy.&nbsp; Our Mr.
Abdul, <a name="citation36"></a><a href="#footnote36"
class="citation">[36]</a> during his residence in Mogador, having
heard that the province of the Sus was rich in mines, and that no
port open for European trade existed south of Mogador, the
grandfather of the present Sultan <a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>having closed Agadhir (formerly known
as Santa Cruz when in possession of the Spaniards), bethought
himself that it would be a master stroke to make a treaty with
the semi-independent chieftains of the Sus, open either Agadhir,
Asaka, or some other port, and trade direct with Europe.&nbsp;
Sus being mainly peopled by Berber tribes, who, it is said, are
the descendants of the Numidians, who certainly were in
possession of the country at the epoch of the invasion of the
Arabs, has always been but ill-affected to the central
government.&nbsp; The town of Tarudant and the Zowia of Si Hamed
O&rsquo;Musa have hitherto been the two chief centres of the
Shereefian <a name="citation37"></a><a href="#footnote37"
class="citation">[37]</a> authority, but recently, from some
fancied slight or from ambitious motives, the representative of
Si Hamed O&rsquo;Musa, one Sidi Hascham, has wavered in his
allegiance to his lord.</p>
<p>That which is most desired by every Arab intriguer is the
possession of good rifles, and it appears that Kerim Bey, Esq.,
promised to help the chiefs to unlimited supplies of
Winchesters.&nbsp; But be this as it may, Kerim appeared in
London with a treaty, real or supposititious, a fez, some twenty
words of Arabic, several tons of assurance, and the experience of
five-and-forty years.&nbsp; With these commodities he got a
syndicate together to engage in trade with the province of the
Sus, open a harbour, divert the caravans which now come from the
interior and the south to Mogador, supply the ingenuous natives
with rifles, bibles, Manchester &ldquo;sized&rdquo; cottons, work
the real or hypothetic mines, introduce progress&mdash;that is
electric light, whisky, and all that&mdash;and give the acrobats
of Taseruelt a reasonable music-hall which might spare them the
long voyage to London to seek a fitting place in which to show
their powers.</p>
<p><a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>The
necessary gentlemen (tribe of Manasseh) with money being found,
it was incumbent to get a man de pelo en pecho, <a
name="citation38"></a><a href="#footnote38"
class="citation">[38]</a> as the Spaniards say, to visit Morocco,
see the Sultan, go to the Sus, and arrange matters with the
various chieftains personally.&nbsp; Like all the world, Abdul
Kerim had many faults, but amongst them the fault of rashness was
not numbered.&nbsp; In his wildest moments he had never asserted
that he personally had penetrated in the little visited Sus; it
was thought if the treaty (which he exhibited, but could not
read) was genuine, that it had been negotiated by a third person
who knew the country well.</p>
<p>Brave men are not so far to seek in London, and one, Major
Spilsbury, soon volunteered.&nbsp; He was the kind of man able
and willing to walk up to a cannon&rsquo;s mouth; the sort of man
who risks his life ten times a day for forty years to gain his
livelihood, and dies&mdash;either by an Indian arrow, Malay
parang, or Arab bullet&mdash;&ldquo;one of our pioneers of
empire&rdquo; or else a &ldquo;foolish filibuster,&rdquo;
according as he succeeds or fails.&nbsp; Quiet and courteous, a
linguist, and brave to rashness, he was the very antithesis of
Abdul; but such as they were they started out together on their
quest.</p>
<p>Sus being the most southern province of Morocco, Abdul Kerim
quite naturally went to the north, and dragged his wondering
companion all round the empire till at last they found the
Sultan, who was in Morocco city, when it turned out that all the
boasted influence Abdul Kerim had set forth he possessed was
nothing, and the Sultan refused permission to trade direct with
Sus.&nbsp; At Mogador the inevitable quarrel took place, and
Abdul started for Montenegro, Muscat or elsewhere, and left poor
Major Spilsbury alone.</p>
<p><a name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>He
being determined to see the adventure through, engaged a Jewish
interpreter, went to the Canaries, chartered a schooner and
landed at Asaka after having entered into negotiations from
Mogador as to his reception with the chiefs.</p>
<p>Eight or ten days he fought with contrary winds aboard his
little unseaworthy schooner, reached Asaka, landed, was well
received, made treaties with the chiefs, and all went well until
an inferior chief, either being bribed by the Sultan or because
he did not think himself sufficiently regarded, or because of the
old antipathy to Christians, ever so strong amongst Mohammedans,
rode up at the head of fifty horsemen and spread confusion
amongst the assembled natives, declaring that he would permit no
Christian to traffic in the land.&nbsp; Shots were exchanged, and
Spilsbury, bearing his treaty, as Camoens bore his poems, had to
escape on board his schooner and for the present leave the
enterprise; though, whilst I write, I should not be surprised to
learn that he was near Asaka with a fresh expedition. <a
name="citation39a"></a><a href="#footnote39a"
class="citation">[39a]</a>&nbsp; Quite naturally the advent of
such a consul from a new country such as &ldquo;Batagonia,&rdquo;
<a name="citation39b"></a><a href="#footnote39b"
class="citation">[39b]</a> his flag, his fez, his name, and all
the subsequent proceedings created some excitement in <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>such a quiet
place as Mogador.&nbsp; Consuls assembled, took counsel, wrote
dispatches, charged for stamps, and generally fulfilled the
functions of their office.&nbsp; Long-bearded Jews, whose talk up
to that time had never strayed from money, now discussed
questions of diplomacy, of international law, discoursed on
piracy, of filibustering, wondered if business would have been
improved if Spilsbury had got a footing, but thought no affair
sublunary could be quite rotten if Daniel Sassoon <a
name="citation40"></a><a href="#footnote40"
class="citation">[40]</a> had had a finger in the pie.</p>
<p>The Arabs generally were puzzled, but pleased to think there
seemed a chance of good repeating rifles being in the market; but
all the European residents saw clearly the hand of
all-encroaching England, and in especial the French were certain
that Mr. Curzon had given his sanction to a plot to extend the
dominion of the empire over Sus.</p>
<p>All things considered, it was a most inauspicious time to
attempt a journey to such a place as Tarudant, guarded most
jealously itself from Europeans both by the fanaticism of the
inhabitants and by the special prohibition of the Moorish
Government to any European to pass south of the Atlas Mountains
to the plains.&nbsp; Hardly had we well landed in the town, when
a report was spread that we were agents of the British
Government, or advance couriers in the interest of the
syndicate.&nbsp; Our sojourn at the house of so well-known a
missionary as Mr. Zerbib in some way allayed the public fear, for
no one credited him with any but purely spiritual views of
conquest.&nbsp; The fact that we had no arms, suggested our great
cunning, for no one doubted that we could lay our hand on stacks
of rifles if we chose, though how we could have done so was a
mystery, as all the influence of our minister at Tangier proved
insufficient to procure me even a pass for a common
double-barrelled gun, so much alarmed <a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>were the authorities after the recent
landing on the coast.&nbsp; No one, except the Turks, more
clearly comprehend that only the jealousy of the European nations
saves their independence than do the ruling classes of
Morocco.&nbsp; They understand entirely the protestations about
better government, progress, morality and all the usual
&ldquo;boniment&rdquo; which Christian powers address to weaker
nations when they contemplate the annexation of their
territory.&nbsp; On the one hand they see the missionary striving
to undermine their faith, and on the other they behold the whisky
seller actually sapping their Mohammedan morality; behind them
both they see the ironclad arriving in their harbours under
frivolous pretences to exact enormous compensation often for
fancied injuries, and they well know the official
Christian&rsquo;s God is money, or as they say themselves,
&ldquo;amongst the Nazarenes all is money, nothing but
money.&rdquo; <a name="citation41"></a><a href="#footnote41"
class="citation">[41]</a>&nbsp; The Moors have vices, plenty of
them, some of them well-known in London and in Paris, but in
their country a poor Mohammedan, unless in case of famine, is
seldom left to starve.&nbsp; Even a begging Christian renegade,
of whom there are a few still left, always receives some food
where&rsquo;er he goes, and is not much more miserable than the
poor Eastern whom one sees shivering about the docks in London
and imploring charity for &ldquo;Native Klistian&rdquo; with an
adopted whine, and muttered national imprecation on the
unsuspecting almsgiver.</p>
<p>The Moors all know when once a European gets a footing in
their land, even although that should be brought about by
filibustering syndicates financed by London capitalists, that the
nation to whom the filibusters belong steps in to guard its
subjects, and having once stepped in, remains for ever.&nbsp;
They see Ceuta, Alhucemas, el Pe&ntilde;on de la Gomera and
Chafarinas all in foreign hands, and like the fact as much as <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>we should
like the Russians in the Isle of Wight.&nbsp; Therefore, their
irritation about the Sus was most intense, and the jealousy of
foreign travellers never keener.</p>
<p>Much has been said about the badness of the Government of
Morocco.&nbsp; Most Governments are bad, the best a disagreeable
institution which men submit to only because they fear to plunge
into the unknown, and therefore bear taxation, armies, navies,
gold-laced caps, and all the tawdry rubbish which takes from
themselves, to furnish living and employment for their
neighbours, under the style and title of national defences, home
administration, and the like.</p>
<p>In countries like Morocco, where men still live under the
tribal system, all government must be despotic; witness Algeria,
Afghanistan, and Russian Tartary.&nbsp; The unit is the tribe and
not the individual, and what we understand by freedom and
democracy would seem to them the grossest form of tyranny on
earth.&nbsp; No doubt no man in all Morocco is secure in the
enjoyment of his property; but then in order to be amenable to
tyranny one must be rich, and as most tribesmen own but a horse
or two, a camel, perhaps a slave, some little patch of cultivated
ground or olive garden, it is not generally on them the extortion
of the Government descends, but on the chief Sheikh, Kaid, or
Governor, who, if he happens to be rich, can never sleep secure a
single day, for he knows well some time he will be brought to Fez
or to Morocco, thrust in a dungeon underground, and made to give
up all he has on earth.&nbsp; True, whilst this very man enjoys
his wealth and place he oppresses all the tribe to the utmost of
his power; but still I fancy that hardly a Moor alive would
change the desultory Eastern tyranny, which he has suffered under
all his life, and under which his fathers groaned since the
beginning of the world, for the six-monthly visit of the tax <a
name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 43</span>collector as
in Algeria.&nbsp; When people in Morocco speak of Algeria they
admit the safety of the roads, the gathered harvests, no hostile
intervention coming between the sickle and the wheat; they admire
the railroads, laugh at the figure which the French soldiers cut
on their horses, but generally finish by saying, &ldquo;the Arab
pays for all, and in that land they tax your dog, your horses,
and you yourself, and all are slaves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Most Europeans point with pride to the curious system known as
&ldquo;protection,&rdquo; and called by the Arabs
&ldquo;Mohalata,&rdquo; which for at least a hundred years has
existed in Morocco, as something to be proud of.&nbsp; The system
needs a few words, as generally writers on Morocco, without a
word of explanation, talk of the custom and state it is a good
one, in the same way that free and fair traders each assume their
nostrum is the best, or as professors of the Christian or
Mohammedan religions look on their dogmas as being alone fitted
for honest men to hold.&nbsp; Briefly, the system of the
&ldquo;Mohalata&rdquo; was invented to obviate the difficulties
of trading in a country so badly governed as is Morocco.&nbsp;
The word in Arabic means partnership, but the system has been
complicated by the habit of protection by means of which the
European partner generally contrives to get his Moorish partner
made a citizen of the country to which he himself belongs.&nbsp;
Thus, &ldquo;Mohalata&rdquo; and &ldquo;Protection&rdquo; have
come to be so mixed together, that it is rare to find a Moor in
partnership with any European and not protected by a European
Consul.&nbsp; Once protected, the Moor ranks as a Montenegrin,
Paraguayan, Englishman, Frenchman, or Portuguese, or what not,
and is removed from the exactions of his own Kaid (governor), and
even is placed outside the jurisdiction of his own Sultan.</p>
<p>So far, so good, for no one can pretend the Sultan&rsquo;s <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>government is
good, and under shadow of the protection system many individual
Moors have become rich.&nbsp; But in their efforts to escape from
their own rule, the wretched Moors often fly from the claws of
Moorish tribal feudalism, and fall into the mouth of European
commercialism, unrestrained by public opinion, the press, or any
of the preventive checks which keep the &ldquo;cash nexus&rdquo;
system within some sort of bounds in England.&nbsp; The following
anecdote may serve to illustrate how the protection system
occasionally works out.&nbsp; Mohammed &mdash; <a
name="citation44"></a><a href="#footnote44"
class="citation">[44]</a> ten years ago was partner of a European
merchant in Mogador.&nbsp; The European (a God-fearing man)
purchased three camels on condition that Mohammed &mdash; should
act as camel-driver, and take the beasts about the country
wherever it was profitable to take goods.&nbsp; A camel in
Mogador may be worth some thirty dollars.&nbsp; For this business
Mohammed was to receive a certain portion of the profits
made.&nbsp; For several years all went well; Mohammed made his
journeys, took his merchandise about, and got his portion of the
gains, feeding the camels at his own expense.</p>
<p>One day the Christian (in Morocco all Europeans pass
colloquially as Christians) said to Mohammed, &ldquo;I intend to
leave the place and to return to Europe.&nbsp; My intention is to
sell the camels, and we can then divide the profits of the sale
according to our deed.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Arab answered he was
willing, and began to cypher up the sum the beasts should bring
when sold.</p>
<p>The Christian then informed him that he had a scheme by which
he thought that they might each gain much, and if it prospered,
that Mohammed could keep the camels for his pains.&nbsp;
Mohammed, nothing loath, sat all attention to hear the expected
plan by <a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>means of which he was to keep his beasts.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You shall take the camels,&rdquo; said the Christian,
&ldquo;and load them for a journey to the Sus.&nbsp; At some
point of the journey thieves shall attack you, and you shall then
throw all the merchandise upon the ground, then return home at
once, and swear before the Cadi that I entrusted you with two
thousand dollars and it is stolen, and I will force the
Government to compel the Sheikh of the tribe where the robbery
was done, to make all good, and we will share the money, and you
can keep the camels for your own.&rdquo;&nbsp; A scheme of this
kind always attracts an Arab; it is just the sort of thing he
would invent himself.&nbsp; And when his own ideas are returned
to him, passed through the medium of a Christian mind, he is
certain that the thing must be all right.&nbsp; Curiously enough,
although the Moors are never tired of cursing at the Christian
sons of dogs, yet they are well aware of their superior business
capabilities, and never seem to doubt their word in matters of
the sort.&nbsp; &ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Mohammed, &ldquo;if I
tell the Cadi that I had your money and that thieves took it, he
will throw me into prison, and there is little chance I shall
ever come out alive.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Have no fear,&rdquo;
said the merchant, &ldquo;the imprisonment will be a mere
formality.&nbsp; I will feed you when you are in prison, and in a
few days you will be free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The camels were duly loaded, and Mohammed set out upon his
journey to the Sus.&nbsp; In a few days he returned, having torn
his clothes, rolled himself in the sand, and with some
self-inflicted bruises, informed his friend the merchant, who
took him to the Cadi to testify on oath.</p>
<p>Most unluckily for the miserable man the place he chose to
pitch upon for the scene of his adventure was a few miles outside
the town, in a district called Taquaydirt.&nbsp; The Cadi sent
for the headman, who <a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>came and swore that he had never seen
Mohammed, and he himself failed to identify any of the natives of
the place, who were presented to him.&nbsp; Seeing the thing
looked grave, he went and took sanctuary in the tomb of Sidi
M&rsquo;Doul, <a name="citation46a"></a><a href="#footnote46a"
class="citation">[46a]</a> the patron saint of Mogador, about a
mile outside the town.&nbsp; Inside the sanctuary the man was
safe, and every day his European friend sent him his food, his
&ldquo;Tajin,&rdquo; <a name="citation46b"></a><a
href="#footnote46b" class="citation">[46b]</a>
&ldquo;Couscousou,&rdquo; <a name="citation46c"></a><a
href="#footnote46c" class="citation">[46c]</a> flat Moorish
bread, and green tea (called Windrisi from Windres, that is
London, from whence it comes), seasoned with mint and sweetened
with enormous lumps of sugar broken with a hammer from the
loaf.&nbsp; A week passed by, and every day his wife and children
came and talked to him, standing outside the shrine, and much
elated at the kindness of their European friend, and of the
affluence which, in a day or two, was to burst on them through
his influence.</p>
<p>But all their feasting did not suit the European&rsquo;s book,
and he contrived to get Mohammed out of the sanctuary, upon the
pretext that it was necessary to swear again to the affair before
the judge.&nbsp; The swearing and examination over, the Cadi (at
the Christian&rsquo;s instigation) threw the poor devil into
prison, and then for a few days the Christian sent him his food,
as he had done before when in the sanctuary.&nbsp; After a day or
two he feigned to think Mohammed had deceived him as to the
robbery, and had really taken the two thousand dollars for
himself.&nbsp; <a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>The supply of food then ceased, and the Christian raised
a plea against the Arab for restitution of his money, or, failing
that, the seizure of his goods.</p>
<p>The wretched man, seeing himself deceived, confessed the plot,
but as he (this time) spoke the truth, no one believed him.&nbsp;
The lawsuit ran its course, and the Arab&rsquo;s wife sold off
his horse and gun (the most cherished property an Arab has), sold
off his camels, their cows, their goats, and sheep, and raised
six hundred dollars after selling everything she had.&nbsp; His
children begged, the wife worked as she could, the husband,
heavily chained in prison, starved.</p>
<p>Five long years passed away, the wife feeding her husband as
she could, the children running about like pariah dogs,
maintained by charity.&nbsp; Then the good Christian merchant
died, and his heirs, of course, still pressed for payment of the
debt.</p>
<p>Four more long years went by, and then a thing occurred which
makes one think of the proverb that &ldquo;to jump behind a bush
is better than the prayers of good men.&rdquo; <a
name="citation47"></a><a href="#footnote47"
class="citation">[47]</a>&nbsp; Within the prison were five
hundred men, Mohammed one of them; a mutiny broke out, the guard
was overpowered, and a few dozen men got out.&nbsp; Then came
Mohammed&rsquo;s turn, and he, thinking that his good deed might
win his freedom, seized the key and locked the door, keeping the
rest within.&nbsp; News went unto our lord the Sultan in his
camp, and people hoped that he might exercise his clemency.&nbsp;
Back came a letter praising Mohammed&rsquo;s deed, and saying he
deserved his liberty, but that the Sultan could not grant it till
the debt was paid.</p>
<p>Ten years have passed away, the merchant is long dead, six
hundred dollars paid for nothing, a family reduced to misery, and
still the victim of the plot remains in prison, heavily chained
and prematurely <a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>old; Allah looks down, the call to prayers rises to
heaven five times a day, and poor Mohammed, a grey-headed man,
resigned and uncomplaining, talks to the casual stranger at the
prison gate and says the Christian was no doubt a knave, but that
the thing was written (mektub), and that therefore no one was to
blame, Allah Ackbar, no God but God, and Lord Mohammed is his
messenger.</p>
<p>The protection system may benefit the Jews, who, once despised
and spit upon by every Moor, have of late years become the
tyrants of the land.&nbsp; Scarcely a Jew of any property in any
Mellah, <a name="citation48"></a><a href="#footnote48"
class="citation">[48]</a> in Morocco, who is not a citizen of
some foreign state.&nbsp; Perhaps America has made the most use
of its protective powers.&nbsp; Both the United States and the
Brazils have frequently named consuls who were quite unworthy of
representing either state.&nbsp; These men, in several instances,
have sold protection right and left, and nothing is more common
than to meet a Moor or a Jew in one or other of the seaport
towns, who tells you that he is a Brazilian or an American.&nbsp;
To-day the United States seem to have seen the error of their
ways, and several of their consuls are of high character, and
fitted to do honour to the post they occupy.</p>
<p>Until quite recently, at times a consul would &ldquo;sell a
Moor,&rdquo; that is would tell his luckless
&ldquo;citizen&rdquo; that, unless by such a time a sum of money
was forthcoming his protection would be withdrawn.&nbsp; The
effect of this would be as a sentence of death to the unlucky
man.&nbsp; Generally the protected citizens amass some money, and
if the protection is withdrawn, their Kaid or Governor falls down
upon them, puts them in prison, where they either die or else
remain till, as the <a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>prisoner in the Gospel, they have paid the uttermost
farthing they possess.&nbsp; As to reclamations, how can a Moor,
speaking no foreign language, go to Andorra, Montenegro, or San
Marino, to appeal.&nbsp; Pay and appeal, <a
name="citation49a"></a><a href="#footnote49a"
class="citation">[49a]</a> the proverb says; but fancy an
Arabic-speaking man, without a cent, appealing in New York, or in
Brazil, in neither of which countries men of dark races are
viewed with favour, and justice is a costly pastime even for the
rich.</p>
<p>No doubt some few have become rich under protection.&nbsp;
Witness the case of Si Bu Bekr, who for so long a time was
British agent, and who, when a few months ago he showed me all
his treasures in his palace in Morocco city, tapped on his iron
chest, and said, &ldquo;This one is gold, that is all jewels;
this, again, is full of bonds;&rdquo; and is assumed to have a
hundred thousand pounds all safely tied up in Consols.</p>
<p>But, on the other hand, sometimes the partnership and
protection is as a shirt of Nessus, and I have heard an Arab say,
&ldquo;Can I not get away from his cursed
&lsquo;Mohalata&rsquo;?&rdquo; rather the exactions of my Kaid
than the insidious bleeding by my Christian partner.&nbsp; Still
it must be confessed that both protection and
&ldquo;Mohalata&rdquo; are much sought after by the natives, and
nothing is commoner than to be asked, whilst on a journey, either
to protect or enter into &ldquo;Mohalata&rdquo; with a
Moor.&nbsp; As in the case of the kindred system which prevails
in Turkey, of &ldquo;capitulation,&rdquo; much abuse creeps in,
and as the country is not ripe for mixed tribunals I suppose the
chicken will have to live and bear its pip. <a
name="citation49b"></a><a href="#footnote49b"
class="citation">[49b]</a></p>
<p>Peacemakers and reformers pass a thankless life, and it
appears as almost every ill we see is irremediable, and as the
world goes on quite cheerfully (no matter what we do), crushing
the weak, and opening wide upon the passage of the strong, that
curses are <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>no use; the only course the wise man can adopt is to
stand well away and keep his own opinions to himself, unless,
indeed, after the fashion of the man in Joseph Conrad&rsquo;s
story, <a name="citation50"></a><a href="#footnote50"
class="citation">[50]</a> he prefers to hang himself, and then
put out his tongue at the world&rsquo;s managing directors.</p>
<p>Finding myself the observed of all observers in Mogador, I
transferred my residence to Mr. Pepe Ratto&rsquo;s International
Sanatorium, about three miles outside the town, which passes
generally under the designation of the Palm-Tree House.&nbsp;
There I essayed to live my filibustering character down, and for
a day or two went sedulously out shooting in the hottest time of
day, to show I was a European traveller; collected
&ldquo;specimens,&rdquo; as butterflies and useless stones; took
photographs, all of which turned out badly; classified flowers
according to a system of my own; took lessons in Arabic, and
learned to ride upon the Moorish saddle.&nbsp; A few days of this
exhilarating life made all things quiet, and the good citizens of
Mogador were certain that I was a <i>bona-fide</i> traveller and
had no design to attack the province of the Sus.</p>
<p>The Sanatori Internacional de la Palmera was a sort of hotel
of the next century.&nbsp; Everything in it was &ldquo;<i>en
construction</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; The managers, two little
Marseillais, of the bull-dog type, spent almost all their time
either in practising <i>la boxe Marseillaise</i>, in playing on
the concertina, an instrument which, when I am in Europe (dans
les pays polic&eacute;s), I fancy obsolete, but which, in days
gone by, set my teeth often aching in the River Plate and in
Brazil.&nbsp; After so many years when first again I heard its
wheezy tones, upon a moonlight night in the Palmera, with camels
resting under the great palm tree, and Arabs lying <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>asleep, their
faces covered in their haiks, horses and mules champing their
corn, hyenas growling in the distance, jackals yelping, and the
frogs croaking like silver cymbals, as they never croak to the
north of latitude forty, it set me wondering why men must go
about on a calm, clear night grinding an instrument to make their
unoffending fellows&rsquo; stomachs ache.&nbsp; Besides the
concertina and &ldquo;la boxe&rdquo; (Marseillaise), the
brothers, curly-headed and pleasant little sons of La Joliette or
La Cannebiere, devoutly entered everything into a ledger, large
enough for Lombard Street, by double entry; and besides that had
an infinity of talents <i>de soci&eacute;t&eacute;</i>, kept
chameleons, understood botany, were cooks and linguists, speaking
most languages including &ldquo;petit n&egrave;gre&rdquo; quite
fluently; were civil, educated, ignorant, and thoroughly good
fellows to the full length of their respective five feet four and
five feet seven inches.</p>
<p>The hotel was on a hill and had a view over a sand hill, on
which grew oceans of white broom, dwarf rhododendrons, gum
cistus, thyme (which in Morocco is a bush), and mignonette, and
in whose thickets wild boars harboured and from which sand grouse
flew whirring out.&nbsp; The owner of the place, a mighty
sportsman, having slain more boars, and had more adventures in
the slaying than any one, since Sir John Drummond Hay laid down
his spear.&nbsp; Born in Mogador, of English or Gibraltarian
parents, and speaking Spanish, English, Arabic, and Shillah quite
without prejudice of one another, Mr. Ratto, known to his friends
as &ldquo;Pepe,&rdquo; fills, in South Morocco, the place that
Bibi Carleton fills in the north.&nbsp; No book upon Morocco is
complete without a reference to both of them.&nbsp; How the thing
comes about I do not know, but not unfrequently the sons of
Europeans born in hot countries turn out failures, either in
person or in mind, or both, but when the contrary occurs and the
<a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>transplanting turns out well, the type is finer than is
common in the mother country.&nbsp; Both of my types would,
walking in a crowd in any town of Europe, attract
attention.&nbsp; Tall, dark, brown-eyed, erect and lithe, clear
brown complexions, open-handed and quick of apprehension, good
horsemen, linguists, and yet perhaps not fitted to excel in
England or in France, or any country where continuous work is
necessary, they have had the sense to stay at home, and become as
it were &ldquo;Gauchos,&rdquo; that is a sort of intermediate
link between the Arab and the European, and at the same time to
incorporate most of the virtues of the two races.&nbsp; Put them
in Western Texas, Buenos Ayres, or South Africa, and they must
have made fortunes; as it is both are as rich as kings when
mounted on a good horse, a rifle in their hands, and a long road
to travel for no special cause.</p>
<p>Not far away begins, sporadically, the district of the Argan
Tree, <a name="citation52"></a><a href="#footnote52"
class="citation">[52]</a> in fact, outside the door of the
Palmera stands a small specimen, the roots almost uncovered and
bent towards the east by the prevailing wind.</p>
<p>Not far away, still lives a patriarch of this restricted
family, flat topped and gnarled and like a Baobab, its branches
taking root all round the stem, and running on the ground for
fully fifty feet, goats climbing on its limbs, snails clinging to
the leaves, pieces <a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>of rag tied to the boughs by passing Arabs, reminding
one of the Gualichu <a name="citation53"></a><a
href="#footnote53" class="citation">[53]</a> tree in the South
Pampa of Buenos Ayres.&nbsp; After long years of life it seems to
rest, putting forth leaves and shoots, and bearing fruit, as if
it were by habit, and as a protest against the decay which has
overtaken all its fellows.&nbsp; The passing Arab, though he may
break a branch to light his fire, still reverences it in a vague
way, never forgetting as he passes to praise God for it, as if
Allah had set it there to tell him of his power.</p>
<p>The choice of guides became a difficulty.&nbsp; Few men in
Mogador cared to attempt a journey to Tarudant in company with a
European, even though disguised.&nbsp; Arabs who knew the way
were terrified at venturing alone into the territory of Berbers,
and Arabs feared to be found out upon the road and put in prison
by the Sultan&rsquo;s governors.</p>
<p>All were agreed the journey was hazardous, although to what
extent they were not sure.&nbsp; Sometimes in travelling in Arab
countries it is possible to take a guide into a certain part, and
then to get some tribesmen to accompany you.&nbsp; In our case
this was impossible, as I could not speak Arabic sufficiently to
pass off as a native of the place.&nbsp; Even to say I was a
Georgian, a Circassian, or Bosnian, for any of which I might have
passed as far as type goes, would have aroused suspicion, for why
should an inhabitant of such a country journey to Tarudant?</p>
<p>Although the place I wished to visit is tabooed for Europeans,
still Arabs, like other men, delight in doing <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>what they
know they should not do, with the full consciousness of doing
wrong.</p>
<p>To the illiterate Moor or Arab nothing seems so wrong as to
eat bacon, pork, or touch a pig, and yet at times they say
&ldquo;I ate some pork the other day, it was magnificent,&rdquo;
after the fashion that boys smoke at schools, pretend to like it,
and are sick behind a hedge.&nbsp; An Arab says no wonder
Christians are so red in the face and look so well, do they not
feed on pork and drink strong wine?&nbsp; It seems to be
implanted in the human mind that anything a man is bidden not to
do, must, of necessity, be the one thing that if he did it, would
make him happy all his life.&nbsp; If this be so, and clergymen
(all of the highest moral standing) have assured me that is the
case, surely the general consensus of the opinion of mankind is
towards doing everything they like, and if that is the case it
must be right, for anything which can secure a majority of votes
is sent from heaven, for God himself is quite uncertain of the
justice of his acts till men have voted on them.</p>
<p>Still, guides for such a journey did not abound.&nbsp; One was
too old, a second too religious to go with Christians, or a third
too big a rogue even to go with Christians; till at the last a
man, Mohammed el Hosein, came forward of his own accord.</p>
<p>Report averred he was a slave-dealer, but the best muleteer in
the country.&nbsp; In person he was thin and muscular, age
thirty-eight, just married, a first-rate horseman, cunning and
greedy, but to be depended on if once he gave his word.&nbsp; All
his delight, as he himself informed me, was to drink green tea
and smoke tobacco, and, therefore, like the old Scotch lady, who,
when a cook was recommended to her for her good moral character,
exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh, damn her morals, can she mak guid
broth?&rdquo;&nbsp; I did not boggle at his slave-dealing, but
took him on the spot.&nbsp; <a name="page55"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 55</span>Strangely enough he had been employed
by missionaries, who spoke well of his capacity touching his
muleteership, but lamented over the hardness of his heart.&nbsp;
By nationality he was a Berber, with the thin face, small eyes,
and high cheekbones of all his race.&nbsp; He sang in Shillah, in
a falsetto voice, a quavering air, both in and out of season, and
seated on a mule, a packing needle in his hand to act as spur,
got over more mortal leagues of country in a day than any other
mule driver whom I remember this side of Mexico.</p>
<p>After the muleteer, came choice of roads, for three were open
to us; the first along the coast passing the town of Agadhir. <a
name="citation55"></a><a href="#footnote55"
class="citation">[55]</a>&nbsp; This road is flat and sandy, and
follows close to the coast right down to Agadhir, and by it
Tarudant can easily be reached within five days from
Mogador.&nbsp; The disadvantages of following this road were
three; firstly, we had to pass the town of Agadhir, in which the
Sultan had a governor; and secondly, Agadhir once passed, we had
to traverse the country of the Howara tribe, which bears an evil
name for turbulence.&nbsp; Journeying, as I proposed to do, in
Moorish dress, two difficulties lay in my path.&nbsp; Firstly, I
might be recognised, and if so recognised by an official of the
central government I should have been turned back at once, as has
already happened to other travellers in South Morocco.&nbsp;
Again, dressed as a Moor and not discovered, I had to run all the
<a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>risks a
Moor must run in travelling, from robbers and from
violence.&nbsp; These risks do not beset a European travelling in
European dress to the same degree, as Moors in general are chary
of meddling with Europeans.&nbsp; It may be asked, why then did I
adopt the Moorish dress, and not go boldly as a European after
having got a permit from the Sultan, and taken a guard of Moorish
soldiers.</p>
<p>These were my reasons: the Sultan of Morocco, when he gives a
European a permit to travel in his territory always writes on it,
after the usual salutations to his various governors, &ldquo;we
recommend this Christian <a name="citation56a"></a><a
href="#footnote56a" class="citation">[56a]</a> to you, see that
he runs no danger.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Moor, reading between the
lines, sees that the Sultan wishes him to stop the Christian
visiting any unfrequented place, and naturally he puts a lion in
the path.&nbsp; Thus, had I gone to Agadhir furnished with guard
and Sultan&rsquo;s letter, the governor would have received the
letter, kissed it, duly placed it on his forehead, called to his
scribe to read it, made me welcome, and informed me that it was
quite impossible for me to go farther, as certain bastards, <a
name="citation56b"></a><a href="#footnote56b"
class="citation">[56b]</a> who feared neither God nor Sultan,
would be sure to kill me on the road.&nbsp; I should have told
him: &ldquo;well, my death be on my own head,&rdquo; and he would
straight have answered, &ldquo;be it so in God&rsquo;s name, if
it were only yours, but who will shelter me from the anger of our
Lord the Sultan if you are killed?&rdquo;&nbsp; Persuasion,
bribes, and everything would have been in vain, and had I then
insisted, I should have found myself politely escorted back by a
guard of cavalry, as all the Sultan&rsquo;s governors are well
aware that their liege lord admits of no mistakes, but punishes
mistakes and faults alike.</p>
<p>Just as I had determined to risk the journey by the <a
name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 57</span>way of
Agadhir, news came that the Howara tribe was in rebellion, and
that the road was shut.&nbsp; There still remained two mountain
passes through the Atlas, one starting from a place called
Imintanout, and going by Bibouan to Tarudant, and still another
from Amsmiz, a town close to Morocco city, which crossed the
Atlas at its greatest breadth and led to Tarudant, across the
River Sus at a place called Ras el Wad, a whole day&rsquo;s
journey from Tarudant.&nbsp; Needless to say both roads were
longer and much more difficult than the coast route, and by
either of them I should have employed at least eight days to
reach my destination.</p>
<p>Choosing the shortest road I then determined to go by
Imintanout, and set about at once to make my preparations for a
start.</p>
<p>Mohammed el Hosein brought his own mule and with it another
belonging to one Ali of the Ha-Ha <a name="citation57"></a><a
href="#footnote57" class="citation">[57]</a> tribe, that is to
say Mohammed hired a mule from Ali who accompanied us (as I
learned upon the road) to see his animal was not
ill-treated.&nbsp; Ali I suspect received no pay, but was a sort
of general <i>homme de peine</i>, and quite contented so that he
received his food and that his mule was fed, and even thought
himself quite fortunate when he received a pair of cast-off
shoes.&nbsp; He had no idea where we were going to, and when we
told him, wished to return, and would have done so had we not
laid hands upon his mule, which seeing, he resolved to brave all
dangers rather than trust it to the tender mercies of Mohammed el
Hosein.&nbsp; For the rest Ali was a muleteer, which race of men,
whether Spaniards, Mexicans, Turks, or Brazilians is all alike,
singing all day while sitting sideways on their beasts, smoking
continually, eating when there is food, and sleeping quite
contentedly (as the unjust all sleep), their heads resting upon a
pack <a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>saddle, feet to the fire, and with a tattered blanket
covering their faces from the dew at night.&nbsp; Lutaif,
following his character of a man of letters, rode on a mule,
perched on a high red pack saddle, which, loosely girthed, after
the Moorish fashion, swayed about and made it quite impossible
for him to mount or to dismount without assistance.&nbsp; By this
time we had bought our Moorish clothes, in which Lutaif, being a
Syrian, looked exactly like one of the figures on the outside of
a missionary journal, which assume to represent biblical
characters, and really are a libel on the Syrian race.&nbsp;
Having arranged to represent a Turkish doctor, I put on the
clothes with some misgivings, and left my room in the Palmera
with the air of one who has assumed a fancy dress.&nbsp; On my
appearance all declared that I need never say I was a Turkish
doctor, for I looked so like a man from Fez, in type and
colouring, that it was better to say nothing as to who I was, and
that the passers-by would take me for a travelling Sherif.&nbsp;
A Sherif being a holy character generally rides upon a horse, and
so I purchased one through the good offices of Mohammed el
Hosein, who happened to know of &ldquo;the best horse in all the
province which his owner wanted to dispose of&mdash;with saddle
and bridle all complete&mdash;for a mere nothing, being short of
cash.&rdquo;&nbsp; I purchased the whole &ldquo;outfit&rdquo; at
nine-and-twenty dollars, a third more than a native would have
paid.&nbsp; The saddle was rotten, and felt like riding on a bag
of stones, but the horse, though lean in condition, was full of
quite unsuspected spirit, sure-footed, and excellent upon the
road.&nbsp; Equipped with horse, high Moorish saddle covered with
red cloth, dressed in white, but with a blue cloth cloak to cover
all, a fez and turban, head duly shaved, and yellow slippers,
with, of course, a pair of horseman&rsquo;s boots (called temag
by the Arabs) buttoned up the back with green silk buttons, <a
name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 59</span>embroidered
down the sides with silk and silver thread, a leather bag to
sling across the shoulders and act as pocket, I was ready for the
start.</p>
<p>Tents and the general camp equipment of a European journeying
in Morocco, did not trouble me.&nbsp; We had a little tent packed
on a mule, just large enough to serve as sleeping quarters for
myself and for Lutaif.&nbsp; The men had to sleep by their mules
after the Moorish fashion, and if it rained to come for shelter
under the lea side of our tent.&nbsp; Cooking utensils were but a
kettle and an iron pot; we had no forks or spoons, as being
dressed as Moors we had to eat after the Moorish fashion with our
hands, our only luxuries being a rather gim-crack brass tea tray,
a pewter German teapot, and six small glasses to drink green tea
flavoured with mint, and made as sweet as syrup.&nbsp; In my
anxiety to be quite the native, I even left my camera, an
omission which I regret, as had I taken it I might have published
a book of views of the Atlas, and saved much trouble to the
public and myself.</p>
<p>A European who came to see us off looked at our modest
equipage with some disgust, and said that he had never seen a
Christian start like a Susi trader, and that we should soon
repent the want of European comforts.&nbsp; Your European comfort
when in Europe is in place; but on the march in a wild country
everything additional you take is as the grasshopper in the
adage, which I think soon made its presence felt.&nbsp; It is
customary for fools and serious men, when setting out on any
journey (say to Margate), finishing books, entering into the more
or less holy state of matrimony, becoming bankrupt, or entering
holy orders, going to sea, meeting their first love, burying
their most disagreeable relation, or being jilted, thrown from a
bicycle, being kicked or knighted, in fact in any of the
disagreeables, which like rain fall on the just and <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>the unjust,
but always show a preference for the poor honest man, to sit down
and record exactly how they felt, what thoughts occurred to them,
and generally to disport themselves as if another mortal in the
world cared they were even born, except their mothers and
themselves.</p>
<p>Time-honoured institution, from which no scribbling traveller
should depart.&nbsp; If you have naught to say, why write it
down, extend it, examine into it, and write and write till after
writing you persuade yourself you have written something; and if
upon the other hand you happen to have aught worth writing, keep
it to yourself, and go to bed remembering that to-morrow is
another day, that thoughts will keep and mules are ever better
saddled about an hour before the sky on the horizon begins to
lighten, and the first faint flush of dawn spreads slowly like a
diurnal Aurora Borealis and drives the morning star back to its
night; for then, as mules are cold and empty, they cannot swell
their stomachs out so much and stop the muleteers from drawing
home the girths.</p>

61</span>CHAPTER III.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Leaving</span> the International
Sanatorium of the Palmera at the hour that Allah willed it, which
happened to be about eight in the morning of the 12th October,
dressed in Moorish clothes, our faces far too white, and our
ample robes like driven snow, the low thick scrub of Argan, dwarf
rhododendrons, and thorny sandarac, and &ldquo;suddra&rdquo; <a
name="citation61a"></a><a href="#footnote61a"
class="citation">[61a]</a> bushes after five minutes&rsquo;
riding swallowed us up, quite as effectually as might have done a
forest of tall trees.&nbsp; Mohammed el Hosein, fully aware of
the importance of getting accustomed to the Moorish clothes
before at once emerging on the beaten track which leads from
Mogador to Morocco city, engaged us in a labyrinth of cattle
tracks, winding in and out for full two hours through stones and
bushes, following the beds of water courses dry with the twelve
months&rsquo; drought, which had caused almost a state of famine,
and calling to us to hold ourselves more seemly, not to let our
&ldquo;selhams&rdquo; <a name="citation61b"></a><a
href="#footnote61b" class="citation">[61b]</a> hang too low, not
to talk English, and when dismounted to walk as befits Arab
gentlemen, to whom time is a drug.</p>
<p>After much threading through the tortuous paths, getting well
torn and sunburned by the fierce sun, we <a
name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>emerged at
the crossing of the river El Ghoreb, which runs into the sea at
Mogador.</p>
<p>Here we encountered the usual stream of travellers always to
be met with at the crossing of a river in countries like Morocco;
grave men on mules going to do nothing gravely, as if the
business of the world depended on their doing it with due
precision.&nbsp; Long trains of mules laden with cotton goods
going up to the capital; a travelling Arab family, the father on
his horse, his gun cased in a red cloth case, balanced across the
pommel of his saddle; his wife, either on foot or seated on a
donkey following him, the children trotting behind, a ragged boy
or two drawing a few brown goats, a scraggy camel packed with the
household goods on one side, and on the other with a pannier from
which a foal stuck out its head; and, lastly, two or three
grown-up girls, who, as we came upon them crossing the stream,
lift up their single garment and veil their mouths according to
the laws of Arab decency.&nbsp; We sit and eat under a tree as
far away as possible from all the passers-by, and our clean
clothes and look of most intense respectability, secure us from
all danger of intrusion on our privacy.</p>
<p>No sooner seated than Swani seized my legs and pulled them
violently, and rubbed the knee-joints after the fashion of a
shampooer in a Turkish bath.&nbsp; On my enquiry he assured me he
knew I must be suffering agony from the short Moorish stirrups
and cramped seat.&nbsp; I had indeed felt for the past half-hour
as if upon the rack; but a horseman&rsquo;s pride and
acquaintanceship with many forms of saddles had kept me
silent.&nbsp; The rubbing and pulling afforded intense relief,
and I acknowledged what I had endured, on his assurance that no
one escapes the pain, and that the most experienced riders in the
land are sometimes kept awake all night, after a long day&rsquo;s
march, owing to the stiffness of their legs.</p>
<p><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>In
medi&aelig;val Spain, good riders were often designated as
&ldquo;Ginete en ambas sillas,&rdquo; <a name="citation63"></a><a
href="#footnote63" class="citation">[63]</a> that is accustomed
to either saddle, <i>i.e.</i> the Moorish and the Christian, and
I now understood why chroniclers have taken the trouble to record
the fact.&nbsp; Strangely enough the high-peaked and
short-stirruped saddle does not cross the Nile, the Arabs of
Arabia riding rather flat saddles with an ordinary length of
leg.&nbsp; The Arab saddle of Morocco, in itself, is perhaps the
worst that man has yet designed, but curiously enough from it was
made the Mexican saddle, perhaps the most useful for all kinds of
horses and of countries that the world has seen.</p>
<p>The Moors girth loosely and keep their saddle in its place by
a broad breast plate; so that it becomes extremely difficult to
mount, and to do so gracefully, you have to seize the cantle and
the pommel at the same time, and get as gingerly into your seat
as possible.&nbsp; Like all natural horsemen, the Moors mount in
one motion, and bend their knees in mounting; thus, in their
loose clothes, they appear to sink into the saddle without an
effort.&nbsp; Once in the saddle a man of any pretension to
respectability has his clothes arranged for him by a retainer, as
being so voluminous, it is quite an art to make them sit.</p>
<p>Swathed in the various cloaks and wrappings which constitute
the Arab dress, the feet driven well home into the stirrups, and
gripping your horse&rsquo;s sides with all the leg, the seat is
firm, though most uncomfortable at first.&nbsp; After a little it
becomes more tolerable, but few men can walk a step without
enduring agony when they dismount after three or four <a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>hours on
horseback, especially as it is a superstition amongst the Moors
to mount and dismount as seldom as they can, for they imagine the
act of getting on and off fatigues the horse far more than the
mere carrying the burden on his back.&nbsp; Of course, both
getting on and off are done in the name of God, that is after the
repetition of the sacramental word Bismillah, used on eating,
drinking, riding or performing any action for which a true
believer should give thanks to Him who giveth benefits to
man.&nbsp; It is the fashion amongst Europeans to sneer at Arab
riding, and no doubt an Arab in the hunting field would not look
well; and it is possible that a hunting man might also find
himself embarrassed to ride a Moorish horse in Moorish saddle
fast downhill over a country strewn with boulders, or at the
&ldquo;powder play,&rdquo; to stand upon his saddle and perform
the feats the Moors perform.</p>
<p>Horsemen and theologians are both intolerant.&nbsp; Believe my
faith, and ride my horse after my fashion, for no Nonconformist,
Cossack, Anglican, Gaucho, Roman Catholic, or Mexican can see the
least redeeming point about his fellows&rsquo; creed, his saddle,
horse, ox, ass, or any other thing belonging to him.</p>
<p>Lunch despatched, green tea drunk, and cigarette carefully
smoked behind a bush, for men in our position must not give
offence by &ldquo;drinking the shameful&rdquo; <a
name="citation64"></a><a href="#footnote64"
class="citation">[64]</a> in the face of true believers, we mount
again, and plunge into an angle of the Argan forest, which
extends from Mogador to Saffi.</p>
<p>Goats climb upon the trees, and camels here and there browse
on the shoots; under the trees grow a few Aras (<i>Callitris
Quadrivalvis</i>), and in the sandy soil some liliaceous plants
gleam like stars in the expanse of heaven.&nbsp; After an hour
the trees grow sparser <a name="page65"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 65</span>and we emerge into a rolling country,
and pass a granary, which marks the boundary between the
provinces of Ha-Ha and Shiadma, and take our last look of the
sea.</p>
<p>The Argan trees become more scarce as we cross into the
fertile and well-cultivated province of Shiadma.&nbsp; Sand now
gives place to rich red earth, and Swani, pricking his mule with
his new dagger, which he had wheedled me to buy him under
pretence that it did not befit my follower to go unarmed, comes
up and asks if, even in England, there is a better cultivated
land.&nbsp; I answer, diplomatically, that there is none,
although perhaps the soil of England in certain parts is just as
rich.&nbsp; Being an Arab he does not believe me for a moment,
but ejaculates, with perfect manners, &ldquo;God is Great, to him
the praise for fertile lands, whether in England or
Morocco.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Kaid&rsquo;s house on a hill stands as the outward visible
sign of law and order, and Mohammed el Hosein imparts the
information that the prison is always full.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis
pleasant to go back, not in imagination, but reality, to the
piping times when prisons were always full, <a
name="citation65"></a><a href="#footnote65"
class="citation">[65]</a> maidens sat spinning (I think) in
bowers, and the gallows-tree was never long without its
&ldquo;knot.&rdquo;&nbsp; This leads me to consider whether, if
all the world were regulated by a duly elected county council,
all chosen from a properly qualified and democratic,
well-educated, pious electorate, and all men went about minding
each other&rsquo;s business&mdash;with fornication, covetousness,
evil concupiscence, adultery, and murder quite unknown, and only
slander and a little cheating left to give a zest to
life&mdash;they would be happier upon the whole than are the
unregenerate Moors, who lie and steal, fight, fornicate, and <a
name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>generally
behave themselves as if blood circulated in their veins and not
sour whey?&nbsp; Despite the Sultan&rsquo;s tyranny, with every
form of evil government thrown in, with murder rampant, vices
that we call hideous (but which some practice on the sly) common
to everyone, the faces of the poor heathen Moors, whom we bombard
with missionaries, are never so degraded as the types which haunt
the streets of manufacturing towns.&nbsp; And if the face is the
best index to the mind, it may be that the degraded heathen Moor
is at the heart not greatly worse than his baptised and educated
rag-clad English brother in the Lord.</p>
<p>As evening falls we pass a shepherd close to the high road,
sitting down to pray, beside him are his shoes and crook, and not
far off his dog looks on half cynically, and up above, Allah
preserves his attitude of &ldquo;non mi ricordo,&rdquo; which is
excusable where men worry him five or six times a day.&nbsp;
Still the shepherd must have been genuine, and could not have
known that infidels would pass his way.</p>
<p>The country here is chiefly composed of red argillaceous
earth, the rock limestone, and the general configuration
round-topped hills rising towards the Atlas.&nbsp; The Argan
trees become more rare, and within sight of our destination we
see the last of them.</p>
<p>The Argan, like the Cacti of the Rio Gila, in Arizona, seems
to be able to resist any drought.&nbsp; Strange that all-wise
Providence failed to endow Africa with either the Cactus or the
Aloe, both plants so eminently suited to its climate.&nbsp; It
was, however, left to poor, weak, erring human reason to supply
the want.</p>
<p>It is pleasing to reflect that for once the powers <a
name="citation66"></a><a href="#footnote66"
class="citation">[66]</a> generally opposed to one another should
have united <a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>in endowing a country with two non-indigenous plants,
which have taken to the soil as if they had been originally found
there.&nbsp; Is it reason after all that is infallible?</p>
<p>Meskala reminded me curiously enough of an
&ldquo;hacienda&rdquo; in Mexico, with an almost similar name
Amascala, the same white walls, the same two towers of unequal
height over the gateway, almost the same corrals for animals
outside, formed in both cases of the branches of a prickly shrub,
goats feeding by the same turbid stream flowing through a muddy
channel, and the gate once opened, which in our case took at
least a quarter of an hour&rsquo;s entreaty mixed with
objurgations, the self-same twisting passage of about twenty
yards in length, through which the stranger enters before
arriving at the great interior court.</p>
<p>The court, about two hundred feet across, was full of animals,
belonging some to the Sheikh himself, and others to the various
travellers who had sought shelter for the night within his
walls.</p>
<p>We had a letter from the consul in Mogador setting forth that
we are friends of his, but not descending to particulars, so that
we were ushered into an airy upper room, and bread and butter, in
a tolerably lordly dish, was set before us.&nbsp; We were
uncertain whether Sheikh el Abbas penetrated my disguise, but if
he did he made no sign; nor did it matter much, as I intended to
be taken for a Christian travelling in Moorish dress to escape
observation (as is often done), till near the place where we
break off into the wilds, and leave the main road to Morocco
city.&nbsp; Had all gone well, I hoped this would confuse the
hypothetic persons, and jumble up their substance to such an
Athanasian extent as to make recognition quite impossible.</p>
<p>Lutaif discourses much of eastern lands and reads <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>el Faredi, an
Arab poet, to the admiration of the assembled elders.</p>
<p>Swani makes tea and Sheikh el Abbas drinks the three cups
prescribed by usage, lapping them like a dog, and drawing in his
breath like a tired horse at water, to show his great
content.&nbsp; The upper room looked out upon the court; and in
the moonlight I saw a shepherd, assisted by a little ragged boy,
engaged in separating the goats from amongst the sheep, and
ranging them in two little flocks, after the fashion that the
good are to be divided from amongst the wicked, when this foolish
affair of life is finished with; though with this difference,
that whereas in this case the two flocks were nearly equal, who
can suppose but that after the last count, the goats will not
exceed the sheep by at least ten to one.&nbsp; In a corral hard
by the horses eat, some camel drivers crouch round a fire, and as
I look at the unchanging Eastern life the call to prayers reminds
me that Allah has blessed it by continuity for a thousand
years.</p>
<p>The Sheikh sat long, talking of things and others, of the
decline of British prestige, the advance of Russia, the new birth
of Turkey, and of the glory of the Moorish kingdoms in the
Andalos (Spain); and then of business, and how the Brus
(Germans), a nation which he says seemed to have come into the
world but recently, from some high mountains, are bidding fair to
be the first of Franguestan.&nbsp; The German Emperor strikes him
as being a great king.&nbsp; He is a Sultan, says the Sheikh,
after the fashion that the Spaniards used to say when Ferdinand
VII. had perpetrated some atrocity, &ldquo;es mucho rey,&rdquo;
that is, he is indeed a king. <a name="citation68"></a><a
href="#footnote68" class="citation">[68]</a></p>
<p>I fancy that he knows I am a Nazarene, although <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>my
conversation is quite evangelical, that is, yea and nay, and now
and then a pious sentence muttered very low to hide the
accent.&nbsp; Lutaif and Swani answer for me, as if I were an
idiot, and step in, so to speak, between me and the Sheikh, as
when he asks, for instance, if I have seen the war ships of the
Christians, when they at once respond I have, and give
particulars invented at the moment, and I learn that ships steam
more than fifty miles an hour, guns carry twenty miles, to all of
which I nod a grave assent, and the Sheikh sips his tea and
praises God for all his mighty works.</p>
<p>Lutaif tells of a vessel at Beirout, a Turkish war ship, sent
by the German Emperor to the Sultan (he of Brus), so large that
two young Syrians of his acquaintance, who had shipped as sailors
and got separated, vainly sought each other for seven years, at
night climbing to the masthead, by day descending to the hold,
but all in vain, because the vessel was so huge; the Sultan could
step aboard of her out of his palace on the Bosphorus and after
walking all day land in whatever country he desired.&nbsp; This
meets with great approval, and I have to confirm it to the
letter, and do so with a nod.</p>
<p>The night is hot and the mosquito hums in his thousand; but
the Sheikh as he goes warns us to bar the door, because, he says,
&ldquo;Sleep is Death&rsquo;s brother,&rdquo; meaning that when
one sleeps death may be near and yet the sleeper be unconscious
of it.</p>
<p>The muleteers retire to sleep beside their mules.&nbsp; Swani
wraps up my feet in the hood of one &ldquo;djellaba,&rdquo; and
draws another up to my head ready to cover it when I feel sleepy,
and as we lie upon the floor, on sheepskins, watching the moon
shine through the glassless window, Lutaif puts out the
flickering wick, burning sustained by argan oil in a brass bowl,
exclaiming, as he did so, &ldquo;Oh, Allah! extinguish not thy
blessing as I put out this light.&rdquo;&nbsp; How much there <a
name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 70</span>is in names;
fancy a deity, accustomed to be prayed to as Allah by Arabs,
suddenly addressed by an Armenian as Es Stuatz, it would be
almost pitiable enough to make him turn an Atheist upon
himself.&nbsp; I feel convinced a rose by any other name would
not smell sweet; and the word Allah is responsible for much of
the reverence and the faith of those who worship him.</p>
<p>We left Meskala early and in rain, which soon was over, and
entering on a little bit of desert country, the Atlas range
appeared like a great wall of limestone capped with white in the
far distance.</p>
<p>For three hot hours we passed through a miniature Sahara,
rocky and desolate, stones, stones, and still more stones and
sand, a colocynth or two lying amongst the rocks, some
orange-headed thistles, Ziziphus Lotus here and there, some
sandarac bushes now and then; the horses stumbling on the stones,
mules groaning in the sand, and no great rock in all the thirsty
land to shelter under from the sun.&nbsp; Three hours that seemed
like six, until a line of green appears, a fringe of oleanders on
the margin of a muddy stream in which swim tortoises, and by
which we lie and lap like dogs, and understand wherefore the
Psalmist so insisted on his green pastures wherein his Allah made
him lie.</p>
<p>In England your green pastures have no significance, and call
to mind but recollections of fat cattle and sheep with backs as
square as boxes, in the lush grass between the hedges, as the
express whirls past and the stertorous first-class passengers
hold up their wine glasses against the light and praise the
landscape as they eat their lunch. <a name="citation70"></a><a
href="#footnote70" class="citation">[70]</a></p>
<p><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>But in
Morocco and Arabia green grass means life, relief from thirst,
and still to-day their poets stuff their verses full of allusions
to the pastures rare to them, but which with us make one at times
long for a bit of brown to break the sea of dull metallic
green.&nbsp; Fig trees and olives, oleanders <a
name="citation71a"></a><a href="#footnote71a"
class="citation">[71a]</a> with pomegranates, and a few palms
make an oasis in the little desert, and on a sheepskin spread on
some cobble stones close by a rock, exactly like the one that
Moses is depicted striking in old-fashioned Sunday books, the
water rushing out in a clear stream, we lie and smoke and fall
a-talking of our chances of reaching Tarudant.</p>
<p>Mohammed el Hosein gave it as his opinion that if he could
conduct a Rumi <a name="citation71b"></a><a href="#footnote71b"
class="citation">[71b]</a> there, he would make his name in
Mogador as the best muleteer in all the south, and all his
previous fears seemed to vanish as he descanted on the line of
conduct to pursue when once inside.&nbsp; He seemed to think the
risk, if known to be a Christian, was considerable, and
counselled that we should encamp outside the gates and reach the
town a little after dawn when people were arriving to sell
provisions, and then go instantly to the Governor&rsquo;s house
which was close to the gates, and claim protection from
him.&nbsp; Swani, who, as a native of Tangiers, though he had
seen the world and twice performed the pilgrimage to Mecca, yet
was a little uneasy in South Morocco, and thought it best that we
should go to some caravansarai (called in Morocco fondak) and try
our best to escape detection, I shamming ill, and Lutaif giving
out he was a Syrian doctor.</p>
<p>Ali the muleteer, who learned for the first time our <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>destination,
was in an agony of fear, and said he must return at once; but
when we pointed out to him that he would then not only lose his
wages but perhaps his mule, he made his mind up, on condition I
procured him a letter of protection from the English consul in
Mogador.&nbsp; Mohammed el Hosein, before he left the town, had
made me sign a paper stating I had engaged him for all his life,
and, fortified with this protection, I understand he now bids all
his governors and masters absolute defiance, wrapped, so to
speak, within a tatter of the British flag.&nbsp; Lutaif, who
knew the Governor of Tarudant, one Basha Hamou, who had been
Governor of Mequinez&mdash;a negro, and a member of the famous
Boukhari <a name="citation72"></a><a href="#footnote72"
class="citation">[72]</a> Pretorian bodyguard&mdash;gave his
opinion that Mohammed el Hosein was right, and that though Basha
Hamou might not be pleased, he would be obliged to give us
protection, and that he, probably after the first excitement of
the natives had subsided, would send us back under escort to
Mogador.&nbsp; I held my tongue, resolving that if we got there I
would not return without a good look at the place.</p>
<p>About a mile from where we sat was situated the castle of the
local Kaid, a castle set upon a rock, and strong enough
apparently to set tribal artillery at defiance; but our Lord the
Sultan being &ldquo;unfavourable&rdquo; to him, the castle was
deserted, cattle stolen, crops all destroyed, and an air about
the place reminding one of some of the Jesuit Missions (destroyed
to show the Liberalism of Charles III.) which I have seen in
Paraguay.&nbsp; In fact the Kaid is only <a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>Kaid <i>in
partibus</i>, and it is understood a Sheikh in Fez has offered
the Sultan 100,000 dollars to be made governor, providing he (the
offerer) might have a &ldquo;free hand&rdquo; with the tribe;
this means to oppress them, and in a year or two to take the
100,000 dollars out of them to pay the Sultan, and as much more
for himself.&nbsp; Strange that the Arabs, though so warlike,
should in all ages have endured so much oppression.&nbsp; It may
be that the tribal system renders them specially liable to this,
for inter-tribal jealousies make them an easy prey to any Sultan
who can command money enough to set them at one another&rsquo;s
throats.</p>
<p>Ibn Jaldun (in the introduction to his history) says:
&ldquo;The Arabs are the least fitted men to rule other nations,
for they demolish the civilisation of every land they
conquer.&nbsp; They might be good rulers, but they must first
change their nature.&rdquo;&nbsp; This no doubt arises from their
incapacity to govern themselves.&nbsp; Still with all their
faults they are a fine race, and if they have demolished the
civilisation of several countries, they have in return left their
own type wherever they have conquered, and what type in the world
is finer.&nbsp; I say nothing of the more doubtful of their
legacies, their system of numeration, and the thoroughbred
horse.</p>
<p>The grateful spring, fruit trees, and shady little oasis where
we rested rejoice in the name of Aguaydirt el M&aacute;, a
compound of Arabic and Shillah, M&aacute; in Arabic meaning the
water, and Aguaydirt, no doubt having some meaning of its own in
the wild tongue it comes from.</p>
<p>As we ride through a bushy country with some straggling farms,
we pass a Sheikh on a good horse, long gun across the saddle, and
a tail of ragged followers on foot.&nbsp; It seems he is a tax
collector, gathering the taxes in person, and no doubt quite as
effectually as the Receivers General used to do in <a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>France,
including even him who sleeps (his bubble burst) under a
flagstone in the door of San Mois&eacute;, <a
name="citation74"></a><a href="#footnote74"
class="citation">[74]</a> in Venice, with a brief dog-Latin
epitaph, setting forth the usual lack of virtues of a man who
fails.</p>
<p>Curious to observe (again per usual) the fatness and good
clothes of the collector, and the mean estate of the poor
&ldquo;taxables,&rdquo; their downcast looks, and all the
apparent shifts and wiles they are putting forth to escape the
worst outrage that a free man can bear, that is to have his money
taken from him under the pretext of the public good.</p>
<p>Pleasant to gather taxes well armed on a good horse; a horse I
mean that could do his ninety miles a day for several days and
carry something heavy in the saddle bags.</p>
<p>I had a friend who, being for a short time governor of a
province in a Central American Republic, and finding things
became too hot for him, collected all the public money he could
find, and silently one night abdicated in a canoe down to the
coast, and taking ship came to Lutetia; and then, his money
spent, lectured upon the fauna and the flora of the country he
had robbed; and, touching on the people, always used to say that
it was very sad their moral tone was low; the reflection seeming
to reinstate himself in his own eyes, for he forgot apparently
that in his abdication he but followed out the course which law
had pointed out to him in his official days.</p>
<p>Night catches us close to el Mouerid, a dullish pile of
sun-dried bricks, the lord of which, one Si Bel Arid, is an
<i>esprit fort</i>, and knowing me for a Christian,
ostentatiously walks up and down talking on things and others to
show his strength of mind.&nbsp; Though disapproving of them,
most Moors like to be seen with Christians, in the same way some
pious men are fond of listening to wicked women&rsquo;s talk, not
that their <a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>conversation interests, but to show the asbestos quality
of their own purity, and to set forth that, as in Rahab&rsquo;s
case no imputation can attach itself to men of virtuous
life.&nbsp; Therefore, as maiden ladies are said to love the
conversation of rakes, and clergymen, that of fallen women, so do
Moors love to talk with and be seen in public with the enemies of
God.</p>
<p>El Mouerid looks miserable in the storm of rain and wind, in
which we leave it as the day is breaking.&nbsp; The Arab dress in
windy weather teaches one what women undergo in petticoats upon a
boisterous day; but still their pains are mitigated by the fact
that generally men are near at hand to look at them, whereas we
could not expect to find admiring ladies on the bleak limestone
plain.&nbsp; Curious striations on the hills, as if the limestone
&ldquo;came to grass&rdquo; in stripes, give an effect as of a
building, to the rising foot-hills, into which we enter by the
gorge of Bosargun, a rocky defile which gradually becomes a
staircase like the road from Ronda to Gaucin, or that to heaven,
almost untrodden of late years.&nbsp; We pass a clump of almond
trees, by which a light chestnut <a name="citation75"></a><a
href="#footnote75" class="citation">[75]</a> mare is feeding; she
looks quite Japanese amongst the trees, buried up to the belly in
aromatic shrubs; a little bird sits on her shoulder, no one is
near her, though, no doubt, some sharp-eyed boy is hiding
somewhere watching her, for in this district no animal is safe
alone.&nbsp; From the top we get our first view of the Atlas in
its entirety; snow, and more snow marking the highest peaks, the
Glawi, Gurgourah, and the tall peaks behind Amsmiz.&nbsp; No
mountain range I ever saw looks so steep and wall-like as the
Atlas; but this wall-like configuration, though most effective
for the whole range, yet robs the individual peaks of
dignity.</p>
<p>To the east the stony plain of Morocco, cut into <a
name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>channels here
and there by the diverted water of the Wad el N&rsquo;fis (a
river I was destined to follow to its very source), under the
highest peaks of Ouichidan, upon the very confines of the
Sus.&nbsp; Here, for the first time, we see, though far below us,
the curious subterraneous aqueducts, looking like lines of tan
pits, with which the plain of Morocco is intersected
everywhere.</p>
<p>These aqueducts, called Mitfias, are a succession of deep
pits, dug at varying distances from one another; the water runs
from pit to pit in a mud channel, and the whole chain of pits
often extends for miles.&nbsp; Men who undertake such herculean
labour in order to irrigate their fields cannot well be called
lazy, after the fashion of most travellers who speak, after a
fortnight&rsquo;s residence in Morocco, of the &ldquo;lazy
Moors.&rdquo;&nbsp; The truth is that the country-people of
Morocco are industrious enough, as almost every people who live
by agriculture are bound to be.&nbsp; Only the Arabs of the
desert, and the Gauchos of the southern plains, and people who
live a pastoral life, can be called lazy, though they, too, at
certain seasons of the year, work hard enough.&nbsp; The Arabs
and Berbers of Morocco work hard, and would work harder had they
not got the ever-present fear of their bad government before
them.&nbsp; When one man quarrels with another, after exhausting
all the usual curses on his opponent&rsquo;s mother, sister,
wife, and female generation generally, he usually concludes by
saying: &ldquo;May God, in his great mercy, send the Sultan to
you&rdquo;&mdash;for he knows that even Providence is not so
merciless as our Liege Lord.</p>
<p>About three miles below us are two curious flat-topped hills,
looking like castles.&nbsp; Mohammed el Hosein pronounces them to
have been the site of two strong castles of the Christians.&nbsp;
What Christians, then?&mdash;Roman, or Vandal, or
Portuguese?&nbsp; Perhaps not Christian at all, but Carthaginian;
for in Morocco, <a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>any old building, the builders of which are now
forgotten, is set down to the all-constructing Christians, in the
same manner as in Spain, the Moors built all the castles and the
Roman bridges, and generally made everything which is a little
older than the grandfather of the man with whom you speak.&nbsp;
Not but at times the person questioned puts in practice, to your
cost, the pawky Spanish saying: &ldquo;Let him who asks be fed
with lies.&rdquo;&nbsp; What Christians could have been so
foolish as to build two castles in a barren plain, far off from
water, does not appear.&nbsp; At any rate, after a careful
search, we can discover no trace of building, and put the castles
down with the enchanted cities Fata Morgana, Flying Dutchman, and
the like phenomena, which seem more real than the material
cities, ships, and optical illusions, which, by their very
realness, appear to lose their authenticity, and to become like
life, a dream.</p>
<p>Passing the castles, we emerged again upon a desert tract,
which took almost two hours to pass, and, at the furthest edge of
it a zowia of a saint, Sidi Abd-el Mummen, with a mosque tower,
flanked by palms, rising out of a sea of olives twisted and
gnarled with age, and growing so thickly overhead that underneath
them is like entering a southern church, out of the fierce glare
of the sun.</p>
<p>History has not preserved the pious actions which caused Si
Abd-el Mummen to be canonised.&nbsp; In fact, Mohammed, if he
came to life again, would have a fine iconoclastic career
throughout the world of the Believers; for though they have not
quite erected idols, graven or otherwise, yet all their countries
are stuck as full of saints&rsquo; tombs, zowias of descendants
of saints, and adoration of the pious dead prevails as much as in
the Greek or Latin churches.&nbsp; True, the custom has its uses,
as it serves to indicate the distance on roads, and men as
naturally enquire their <a name="page78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>way from Saint (Sidi) to Saint, as
from church to church in Spain, or public-house to public-house
in rural England.&nbsp; In other countries Saints, before
becoming free of the fellowship, have to show their fitness for
the post; but in Morocco no probation of any kind&mdash;that is,
according to our ideas&mdash;seems to be necessary.</p>
<p>I knew an aged man, who used to sit before the Franciscan
Convent, in the chief street of Tangier&mdash;a veritable saint,
if saint exists.&nbsp; He sat there, dressed in a tall red fez,
<a name="citation78"></a><a href="#footnote78"
class="citation">[78]</a> given by some pious soldier, a long
green caftan, clean white drawers, and a djellab of fine blue
cloth.&nbsp; Long hair descended on both sides of his face in
locks like bunches of chrysanthemums; his eyes were piercing, and
yet wavering; for the poor Saint was nearer to Allah than the
common herd by the want of some small tissue, fibre, or supply of
blood to the vessels of the brain.&nbsp; Thus clothed and
mentally accoutred for his trade, a basket by his side, and in
his hand a long pole shod with iron, for he belonged to the sect
called the Derkowi, he sat and told his beads, and took his alms,
with an air of doing you a favour: for who gives to the poor does
them no favour, but, on the contrary, insures his own eternal
happiness, and but gives out again that which Allah entrusted to
him for the behoof of man.</p>
<p>I happened one day, with European curiosity, to enquire what
made the venerable man so venerated, and was told that, having
suddenly gone mad, he <a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>killed his wife, threw off his
clothes, and then marched naked through the land&mdash;justice
not interfering&mdash;for the mad are wise; and then, the
violence of his madness over, had quietly sat down and made
himself a sort of &ldquo;octroi&rdquo; upon passers by, after the
fashion of blind Bartim&aelig;us, who sat begging at the
gate.&nbsp; The explanation pleased me, and in future when I
passed I laid up treasure in that mothless territory, where no
thieves annoy, by giving copper coins; and was rewarded even here
on earth, for once I heard an Arab say: &ldquo;This Kaffir,
here&rdquo; (speaking of me) &ldquo;fears neither God nor devil,
yet I have seen him give to the old Saint; it may be, God, the
merciful, may save him yet, if but to show His might.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so it is that Saints&rsquo; tombs stud the land with
oven-shaped buildings with a horse-shoe arch, a palm tree growing
by, either a date or a chamcerops humilis, in which latter case
pieces of rag are hung to every leaf-stalk, perhaps as an
advertisement of the tree&rsquo;s sanctity or from some other
cause.&nbsp; The place serves as a re-union for pious folk, for
women who pray for children, for gossipers, and generally holds a
midway place betwixt a church and club.&nbsp; In order that the
faithful wayfarers, even though idiots, shall not err, in
mountain passes, as in the gorge of Bosargun, at four cross
roads, passes of rivers, and sometimes in the midst of desert
tracts the traveller finds a number of small cairns, in shape
like bottles, which show&mdash;according to the way they
point&mdash;where the next Saint&rsquo;s tomb lies; for it is
good that man should pray and think about himself, especially
upon a journey&mdash;prayer acts upon the purse; alms save the
soul; and Saints, though dead, need money to perpetuate their
fame.</p>
<p>After nine hours of alternating wind and heat we reached
Imintanout, the eastern entrance of the pass which, crossing a
valley of the Atlas, leads to Sus.&nbsp; <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>So to speak
Tarudant is within hail, three (some say two) days and we are
there, if . . . but the if was destined to be mortal, as it
proved.&nbsp; The straggling village almost fills the gorge
through which the road enters the hill.&nbsp; Above it towers the
Atlas; a little stream (then dry) ran through the place, which
had an air between a village in Savoy, and a Mexican mining town
lost in the Sierra Madre.&nbsp; Brown houses built of mud,
stretches of Tabieh <a name="citation80a"></a><a
href="#footnote80a" class="citation">[80a]</a> walls, the tops of
which crowned with dead prickly bushes, steely and bluish looking
in the setting sun, the houses generally castellated, the gardens
hedged in with aloes, wherein grow blackberries, palms and
pomegranates, flowers, fig-trees, and olives.&nbsp; Water in
little channels of cement, ran through the gardens, making of
them an Arab paradise.&nbsp; Further up the gorge the Mellah
(Jewry), in which we catch a glimpse for the first time of the
Atlas Jews, servile and industrious, wonderfully European-looking
as to type, superior to the Arabs and Berbers in business
capacity, and thus at once their masters and their slaves.</p>
<p>The Kaid&rsquo;s house, perched upon a rock, I avoided like a
plague spot, fearing to be recognised and sent back to Mogador,
and made, instead, for the house of one Haj Addee, a Sheikh, <a
name="citation80b"></a><a href="#footnote80b"
class="citation">[80b]</a> which being interpreted may stand in
his case for country gentleman.</p>
<p><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>The
Sheikh has been in Mecca, Masar el Kahira (Cairo), carries a
rosary, has some knowledge of the world (Mohammedan), and is not
quite unlike those old world Hidalgos of La Mancha, they of the
&ldquo;Rocin flaco y galgo corredor,&rdquo; whom Cervantes has
immortalised in the person of Don Quixote.</p>
<p>Friends interested in my journey in Mogador had recommended
the Sheikh to me as a safe man in whom to trust, before engaging
myself in the recesses of the Atlas.&nbsp; So, riding to his
house, I sent in Swani with a letter from an influential man in
Mogador, and Haj Addee soon appeared, and, after asking me to
dismount, led me by the hand to his guest house.&nbsp; This was
an apartment composed of three small rooms, one serving as a
bedroom, the second as a place in which to store our saddles,
tent, and camping requisites, and the third, which had no roof,
as sitting-room.&nbsp; All round the sitting-room ran a clay
divan, a fire burned in one corner, and overhead the stars shone
down upon us, especially the three last stars in the Great
Bear&rsquo;s tail, so that, take it for all in all, it was as
pleasantly illuminated a drawing-room as any I have seen.&nbsp;
Hard by the door stood an immense clay structure, shaped like a
water barrel, which served for storing corn <a
name="citation81a"></a><a href="#footnote81a"
class="citation">[81a]</a> in during the winter, and in the
spring broken to pieces when the corn was used.</p>
<p>Seated on the divan, I watched an enormous copper kettle try
to boil upon a brass tripod <a name="citation81b"></a><a
href="#footnote81b" class="citation">[81b]</a> in which a little
charcoal glowed, whilst in a small brass dish a wick fed with raw
mutton fat made darkness manifest.&nbsp; <a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>As I look
round the room it strikes me that there seems to be a sort of
dominant type of Mohammedan formed by religion, in the same way
that in the north of Ireland you can distinguish a Catholic from
a Protestant, across the street.&nbsp; Mohammed el Hosein, though
of a different race, and from thousands of miles away, presents
the perfect type of an Afridi, as depicted in the columns of the
illustrated papers.&nbsp; Ali, our muleteer, with his thin legs,
beard brushed into a fan, and coppery skin, might sit for the
picture of a Pathan; it may be that an Oriental would discern a
great resemblance between a Dutchman and a Portuguese which had
lain dormant to our faculties, and if this was the case my theory
would be as well confirmed as many other theories which have
revolutionised the scientific world.</p>
<p>We talk of Mecca and Medina, of travelling from Jeddah,
stretched in &ldquo;shegedefs&rdquo; <a name="citation82"></a><a
href="#footnote82" class="citation">[82]</a> upon a camel&rsquo;s
back, of Gibel Arafat, the Caaba, and of the multitude of
different classes of Mohammedans who swarm like bees, Hindoos and
Bosnians, Georgians, Circassians, the dwellers in the Straits,
and the Chinese believers, whom my host serves up all in a lump
as Jawi, and says that they are little, yellow, all have one
face, and that their mother in the beginning was a Djin.&nbsp; It
appears that at the sacred places, the town of tents is of such
vast dimensions that it is possible to lose yourself and wander
for miles if you forget to take the bearings of your tent.&nbsp;
It must be a curious sight to see the various nationalities, the
greater part of whom have no means of communication other than a
few pious sentences, and a verse or two from the Koran.</p>
<p>Swani, who is a double pilgrim, having twice been <a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>in Mecca,
comes out most learnedly as to nice points in Mohammedan
theology.&nbsp; Though he can neither read nor write, and is, I
fear, not all too strict in the mere practice of his religion,
yet he can talk for hours upon the attributes of God, and as
judiciously as if he had been a graduate of St. Bees, so well he
knows the essence, qualities, power, majesty, might, glory, and
every proper adjective to be applied.&nbsp; The object of his
hopes is to induce me to perform the pilgrimage.&nbsp; He assures
me that it is quite feasible, has even arranged for my disguise,
and tells me that in Mecca he can take me to a friend&rsquo;s
house, who is as big a Kaffir as myself.&nbsp; His idea is that I
shall go as a Circassian, which people I resemble as to type, and
when I say, &ldquo;What, if I fall upon a real Circassian?&rdquo;
he only answers, &ldquo;That is impossible,&rdquo; in the same
manner as when asked what they would do if they discovered me; he
answers, &ldquo;they would not discover you, you look so like a
man from Fez.&rdquo;&nbsp; What annoys him is that I make no
apparent progress in the language, and I fear that I shall have
to take a longer pilgrimage before I am fit, even with such a
guide, to throw the stones on Gibel Arafat.&nbsp; Sometimes our
talk ran on the wonders of the West; the steamships in which the
pilgrims sail from Tangier to Jeddah, and on board of one of
which, our host informs us, once when he was praying, the Kaffir
Captain touched him on the arm, and, pointing to the compass,
informed him he was not head on to the proper point.&nbsp; This
conduct seems to have impressed Haj Addee, and he remarks,
&ldquo;God, in his mercy, may yet release that captain from the
fire.&rdquo;&nbsp; As we were talking, neighbours dropped in, in
the familiar Eastern way, and sat quiet and self-contained,
occasionally drinking from one of the two long-necked and porous
water-jars, known as &ldquo;Baradas,&rdquo; or the
&ldquo;coolers,&rdquo; which stand, their wooden stoppers tied to
them with a palmetto cord, on each <a name="page84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>side the divan.&nbsp; Swani concocts
the tea, using the aforesaid weighty copper kettle, a pewter
cone-shaped tea-pot, made in Germany, a tin tea-caddy, painted
the colour of orange marmalade, with crude blue flowers, which
kind of merchandise Birmingham sends to Morocco, to be sold at
one-and-sixpence, to show how much superior are our wares to
those of all the world.&nbsp; The host knocks off great pieces
from a loaf of cheap <a name="citation84"></a><a
href="#footnote84" class="citation">[84]</a> French sugar with
the key of the house, drawing it from his belt, and hammering
lustily, as the key weighs about four ounces, and is eight or
nine inches long.</p>
<p>Imintanout being, as it were, the gate of Sus, and the end of
the first stage of our journey, we ask most anxiously as to the
condition of the road.&nbsp; The way we learn is easy, so easy
that trains of laden camels pass every day, and the whole
distance across the mountains is a short two days.&nbsp; So far
so good, but when we intimate our intention of starting early
next morning, then bad news comes out.</p>
<p>It appears the tribe called Beni Sira, sons of burnt fathers,
as our host refers to them, have stopped the pass, not that they
are bad men, at least our host is sure of this, or lives too near
them to venture on a criticism, but because they are dissatisfied
with the new governor recently appointed, and wish to get him
into bad odour with the Sultan by causing trouble.&nbsp; It
appears those mis-begotten folk have fired upon a party only the
day before, and wounded a Jewish merchant, who is laid up in a
house not far from where we sit.&nbsp; A caravan of twenty mules
was set upon last week, two men were wounded and the goods all
carried off.&nbsp; A most ingenious system of proving that the
governor is incompetent to preserve order, and therefore must be
changed.</p>
<p>Suspecting that the story was untrue, and only <a
name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 85</span>got up to
prevent my entering the Sus, I sent two messengers, one to see
the Jewish merchant, and tell me if he is really wounded, and
another to a Sheikh, asking if a traveller, going to pray in
Tarudant, and skilled in medicine, can pass that way.&nbsp; The
report of fighting seriously alarms our muleteers, and even
Swani, though brave enough, looks grave at having to fight so far
away from home.&nbsp; Haj Addee&mdash;to show goodwill, or to
impress us with his power&mdash;offers, should the local Sheikh
of the Beni Sira return an unfavourable reply, to get his men
together and fight his way right through the pass.&nbsp; I thank
him with effusion, but resolve not to place myself alone in the
middle of a tribal battle without a rifle, on a half-tired horse,
and deprived even of a Kodak with which to affright the nimble
adversary.</p>
<p>And so I lose a day, or perhaps gain it, talking to the
curious people, and prescribing wisely for ophthalmia; dividing
Seidlitz powders into small portions to be taken at stated times
to serve as aphrodisiacs, and watching an incantation which seems
to cure our host of rheumatism.</p>
<p>Haj Addee was a sort of &ldquo;Infeliz,&rdquo; as the
Spaniards call a man of his peculiar temperament.&nbsp; I am
certain that in whatever business he entered into he must have
failed, he had so honest a disposition, and his lies were so
unwisely gone about, they would not have deceived a Christian
child.&nbsp; His rosary, each bead as big as a large pea, was
ever in his hand; he said it was made from the horn of that rare
beast, the unicorn, and he had brought it with a price at Mecca,
from a &ldquo;Sherif so holy that he could not lie.&rdquo;&nbsp;
It looked to me like rhinoceros horn, and so, perhaps, the Sherif
had lied less than he had intended when he sold the beads.&nbsp;
In the middle of the string were four blue beads, and between
these four beads a piece of ivory standing up like a cone, and <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>called
&ldquo;el Madhna,&rdquo; <a name="citation86a"></a><a
href="#footnote86a" class="citation">[86a]</a> that is the
&ldquo;erect one.&rdquo;&nbsp; Besides the &ldquo;Madhna&rdquo;
there was a little comb, shaped like a stable mane comb, and made
of horn, which dangled from the rosary, and which Moors use to
comb their beards after performing their ablutions, and which
they seldom carry in Morocco, except they have performed the
pilgrimage.</p>
<p>Haj Addee suffered from rheumatism in the left shoulder.&nbsp;
This he called simply &ldquo;el burd,&rdquo; &ldquo;the
cold,&rdquo; and complained that he had exhausted all lawful
medicine and was about to try an incantation. <a
name="citation86b"></a><a href="#footnote86b"
class="citation">[86b]</a>&nbsp; So to us entered a
&ldquo;fakir&rdquo;&mdash;that is, a holy man&mdash;fat and
white-bearded, and with the half-foolish, half-cunning look, so
often to be found in &ldquo;holy men&rdquo; who are professors of
some faith either inferior to, or differing from, our own.&nbsp;
The man of God gave me a scowl, and, I fancy, saw I was a
misbeliever, then sat down, after the fashion of his class, in
the best seat, and, mumbling something, drew out a dagger and
wrote upon it, with the juice of a plant he carried in his hand,
some mystic characters.&nbsp; The master of the house, together
with a friend, stood up and held two pieces of split cane about a
yard in length.&nbsp; Both had the air the Italians call
&ldquo;compunto,&rdquo; that is, they looked like people walking
down the aisle of a crowded church (as if they trod on eggs)
after partaking of the Holy Communion, and conscious that it is
not impossible they may have eaten and drunk their own damnation,
and that before a crowd of witnesses.</p>
<p>The Levite, sitting in a corner, kept on muttering, and
underneath the cane rapidly passed the cabalistic dagger to and
fro, just in the middle of the reeds, <a name="page87"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 87</span>touching them lightly, as the dagger
moved almost like a shuttle in his hands.&nbsp; The look of
concentration and air of being accomplices after the fact was
kept up for almost five minutes, and quite insensibly I find I
joined in it, and, looking at Lutaif (a Christian, if such a man
there be) at Swani and Mohammed el Hosein, I found that they too
were fascinated, much like a rabbit in a snake-house moves
towards the snake.</p>
<p>It seems, of all the forces which move mankind, humbug is the
strongest, for humbugs are always taken in by humbug, and the
very men who practice on the folly of mankind fall easy victims
to the man&oelig;uvres of their brothers in the art.&nbsp;
Gradually the movement of the dagger grew slower, then stopped,
and then the mystery man struck the patient gently with the blade
upon the arm, broke the two canes across, tied them together in a
bundle, and put them on a ledge just where the thatch is fastened
to the mud walls of the house.</p>
<p>Admirable to observe the look of faith of all the
standers-by.&nbsp; If ever I witnessed a religious action, that
is, taking religio and superstitio (as I think the Romans did) to
be synonymous, I did so then.&nbsp; Even the Salvation Army, at
its most unreasonable, never succeeded in bringing such a look of
ovine faith upon the faces of its legionaries.&nbsp; The patient
says that he is greatly benefited, and for the first time in my
life I see a religious ceremony begun, continued, and concluded
(with the result successful), and without apparent sign of a
collection being taken up.</p>
<p>Faith should not be divorced from its true spouse, the
offertory.&nbsp; What man has brought together, even the act of
God should not disjoin, for faith is so ethereal that, left
alone, it pines and languishes in a hard world, unless sustained
by pennies in a plate, in the same manner as the soul, which, as
we all know (nowadays), is eternal, takes its departure when <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>the body
dies, and lies unquickened if the head receives a knock.</p>
<p>The function over, we sit and talk, look at one
another&rsquo;s arms, lie as to our shooting powers, and, after
careful examination of my pistol, to my astonishment, our host
produces a large-sized Smith and Wesson revolver, which it
appears he bought in Kahira (Cairo), and seems to think the most
important result of all his pilgrimage.&nbsp; Hours pass, and
still no messenger, and a fat Saint <a name="citation88"></a><a
href="#footnote88" class="citation">[88]</a> rolls in, and
salutes Swani as an acquaintance of the pilgrimage.&nbsp; They
kiss and embrace, hugging one another and alternately placing
their beards over one another&rsquo;s right and left
shoulders.&nbsp; As Burton observes, the Arabs are by far the
most emotional of the Oriental races.&nbsp; Poetry, or a
well-told lamentable tale, moves them to tears, and friends who
meet often weep for joy.</p>
<p>Swani privately imparts to me, in Pigeon Spanish, which he
tells the Saint is Turkish, that the Saint is a humbug, and that
when they last met he would hardly speak to him, for he (Swani)
was working as a sailor on board an English pilgrim steamer, and
dressed &ldquo;a la inglesa, saber del trousers, catchy sea boots
y todo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still waiting for the messenger, I fall to observing the
difference between the Arabs and the Berber race.&nbsp; It is the
fashion amongst travellers in Morocco and Algeria to exalt the
Berbers, and run down the Arabs.&nbsp; &ldquo;The noble Shillah
race&rdquo; has become quite a catch-word with every one who sees
a Berber and writes down his impressions.&nbsp; Curious that no
one talks of the noble &ldquo;Tuareg race,&rdquo; yet the
Tuareg&rsquo;s are Berber of the Berbers, and their language,
known as Tamashek, merely a dialect of the Berber <a
name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 89</span>language,
which spreads over the vast area of territory from Tripoli to the
Atlantic Ocean, and from the Mediterranean to Timbuctoo.&nbsp;
Undoubtedly the oldest known inhabitants of the countries which
now are called the Barbary States, they seem to have kept their
type and customs unchanged since first we hear of them in
history.&nbsp; The Arabs found them in possession of all Morocco,
and drove them into the mountains and the desert beyond, and
though they forced Islam upon them, still the two peoples are
anti-pathetic to one another, have blended little, and you can
tell them from one another at a glance.</p>
<p>The Arab, one of the finest types of all the races of mankind,
tall, thin, fine eyes, aquiline noses, spare frames; walking with
dignity; a horseman, poet; treacherous and hospitable; a
gentleman, and yet inquisitive; destroying, as Ibn Jaldun assures
us, the civilisation of every land they conquer, and yet capable
of great things, witness Granada and Damascus; a metaphysician
and historian; sensual and yet abstemious; a people loveable, and
yet not good to &ldquo;lippen to,&rdquo; as Scotchmen say; and
yet perhaps of all the Orientals those who have most impressed
themselves upon the world.</p>
<p>The Berbers, short, squat figures, high cheekbones, small
eyes, square frames, great walkers, only becoming horsemen by
necessity, as when the Arabs have forced them to the desert; as
fond of mountains as the Arabs are of plains; in general
agriculturists, whereas the Arab in his true sphere prefers a
pastoral life; the Berbers, little known outside their mountains,
look rather Scottish in appearance, that is, Scotch as ordinary
mortals see that race, and not as seen through
&ldquo;kailyard&rdquo; spectacles.&nbsp; It may be that the
Berbers are a noble race, but personally I should apply the
adjective &ldquo;noble&rdquo; to the Arabs, and to the Berbers
give some such qualifying phrases <a name="page90"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 90</span>as &ldquo;relatively honest,&rdquo;
&ldquo;tenacious,&rdquo; or perhaps, best of all,
&ldquo;bourgeois,&rdquo; which, to my way of thinking, best
expresses the characteristics of those Berber tribes who, in the
north side of the Atlas, are dominated by the Sultan&rsquo;s
power.&nbsp; Where they touch one another to the south upon the
confines of the desert, it would be hard to give the palm for
savagery; and the great Berber tribes, Ait Morghed and Ait <a
name="citation90a"></a><a href="#footnote90a"
class="citation">[90a]</a> Hannu, have become practically Arabs
in their customs and their use of horses.&nbsp; The Tuaregs, <a
name="citation90b"></a><a href="#footnote90b"
class="citation">[90b]</a> on the other hand, have remained
absolutely Berber, and indiscriminately attack Arabs and
Christians, and all who cross their way.</p>
<p>As to the name of Berber, ethnologists, after the fashion of
all scientists, have disagreed, taken one another by the beards,
and freely interchanged (and I suppose as faithfully received)
the opprobrious names which render the disputes of men of science
and of theologians so amusing to those who stand aside and put
their tongues out at both sorts of men.</p>
<p>Breber, Baraba, Berber, all three phases of the word are
found.&nbsp; Some learned men derive the word from the Greek, and
make it simply stand for Barbarian.&nbsp; Others, again, as
stoutly make it Arab, and say it means &ldquo;People of the Land
of Ber.&rdquo; <a name="citation90c"></a><a href="#footnote90c"
class="citation">[90c]</a></p>
<p><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>Ibn
Jaldun (always an innovator) has his theory, which seems just as
good as any other man&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He makes the Berbers to
descend not from Shem, but Ham (Cam as the Arabs call him), and
relates that Ham had a son called Ber, whose son was called
Mazirg, and that from Ber came the Beranis, who, in time, and by
corruption of the word, turned into Berberes.&nbsp; If not
convincing, the theory shows invention, and smacks (to me) of the
derivations I have heard hacked out, so to speak, with a scalping
knife round the camp-fire; for, uncivilised and semi-civilised
men waste as much time in seeking to find out how the form of
words got crystallised as if they had diplomas from their
universities.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, the people we call Berbers do not know the
name, and call themselves Tamazirght, that is, the noble.&nbsp;
Their language is called Amzirght, and resembles closely the
Tamashek spoken by the Tuaregs, the dialect of the tribes of the
Riff Mountains, and that of the Kabyles of Algeria. <a
name="citation91a"></a><a href="#footnote91a"
class="citation">[91a]</a>&nbsp; The Arabs neither use the word
Tamazirght nor the word Berber, but call the Berber tribes
&ldquo;Shluoch,&rdquo; that is, the outcasts; the verb is
&ldquo;Shallaha,&rdquo; and the term used for the speech Shillah,
<a name="citation91b"></a><a href="#footnote91b"
class="citation">[91b]</a> a sort of Shibboleth <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>in
Europeans&rsquo; mouths, for very few even of those (who, like
the Germans and the Spaniards can pronounce the guttural) ever
attain to the pronunciation of the Arabic and Berber
semi-guttural, semi-pectoral aspiration of this word.</p>
<p>Till the last twenty years the greater portion of the Berber
tribes, although Mohammedans, owned but a nominal allegiance to
the Sultan of Morocco, and lived almost independently under their
Omzarghi (lords), Amacrani (great one), and Amrgari (elders), but
nowadays, even in Sus and in the desert, the Sultan&rsquo;s
authority is much more felt.&nbsp; In fact, until quite lately
they lived as their forefathers&mdash;the Getulians,
Melano-getulians, and Numidians&mdash;lived before them, with the
exception that being driven to the mountains they had greatly
lost the horsemanship which made them famous to the ancient
world.&nbsp; Even to-day it is not rare to see them ride, just as
the Roman writers said the ancient Numidian cavalry rode, without
a saddle or a bridle, and guiding their horses with a short
stick, which they alternately change from hand to hand to make
them turn.</p>
<p>The words Mazyes, Mazirici&aelig; and Mazyces occur in many
Greek and Roman writers, and seem not impossibly to be derived
from Amazirght, or from Mazig, the most ancient form known of
their appellation.&nbsp; Leo Africanus, himself a Moor, <a
name="citation92"></a><a href="#footnote92"
class="citation">[92]</a> calls them Amarigh, and says of them
&ldquo;they are strong, terrible, and robust men, who fear
neither cold nor snow; their dress is a tunic of wool over the
bare flesh, and above the tunic they wear a mantle.&nbsp; Round
their legs they have twisted thongs, and this serves them <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>also for
shoes.&nbsp; They never wear anything on the head at any season;
they rear sheep, mules and asses, and their mountains have few
woods.&nbsp; They are the greatest thieves, and traitors, and
assassins in the world&mdash;&rdquo; <a name="citation93"></a><a
href="#footnote93" class="citation">[93]</a></p>
<p>Even to-day this picture of them holds good in most
particulars.&nbsp; The Berbers of the mountains seldom wear
turbans or anything but a string tied round their
foreheads.&nbsp; Generally they have a linen shirt to-day, but
often wear the tunic as Leo Africanus says, and now and then one
sees them with the twisted leg bandages like Pifferari.&nbsp; As
to their moral character, after some small experience, I rather
hold to the view of Leo Africanus, than that of Mr. Walter
Harris.&nbsp; One thing is certain, that they cannot lie more
than the Arabs do, but then the Arabs lie so prettily, with so
much circumstance, and such nice choice of words, that it all
comes to be a matter of individual taste, for there are those who
had rather be deceived with civil manners by an Italian, than be
cheated brutally by a North Briton, for the love of God.</p>
<p>The first of all the tribes we hear of in history as living in
Morocco are the Autoloti of Ptolemy, who seem to be the Holots,
who now live in El Gharb, that is, the country between Tangier
and the Sebu.&nbsp; In Hanno&rsquo;s Periplus, the same word
occurs, and the description of their country seems to tally with
the territory where they live.</p>
<p>Luis de Marmol, who was long prisoner with the Moors in the
sixteenth century, places a people called Holots, near to Cape
Azar.&nbsp; Now it is certain that the Holots are Berbers, and
the testimony of the writers referred to goes to prove the long
continuance of the Berbers in the land, and also seems to prove
that in ancient times, as now, the Berbers were not <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>nomads, as
the Arabs were, but stationary, as they are to-day.&nbsp; Graberg
di Hemso, in his curious &ldquo;Speechio Geographico di
Marocco,&rdquo; says, &ldquo;Questi Mazighi della Tingitana
fabbricarono, ne quella costa in vincenanza del capo Bianco la
citta di Mazighan, che porta ad oggi il loro nome di
nazione.&rdquo;&nbsp; He quotes no authority for his statement,
and it is certainly at variance with fact, for Mazagan was
founded by the Portuguese in 1506, and it is called Djedida,
<i>i.e.</i>, New Town, by the Arabs; still the name of Mazagan
may yet commemorate an older town under the style of
Mazighan.</p>
<p>Be all that as it may, the Berbers inhabited Morocco ages
before the Arabs conquered the land, and gave them the religion
of the sword.&nbsp; Tradition says they were once Christians, and
certainly in their embroideries and decorations the cross is
used.&nbsp; Yet, looking at the matter from an artistic point of
view, discounting (for the nonce) morality, the cross, and
honesty, it seems to me that noble is not a term to use in
speaking of the Berber, and I submit it better fits a race such
as the Arabs, who, in the persons of their horses and themselves,
have done so much to refine the type of all those peoples, equine
and biped, whom they have come across.</p>
<p>As night was falling, and a whistling wind springing up from
the mountains, the messenger appeared bringing the news that the
Sheikh refused to let anyone cross the pass, and that there had
been a pretty hot exchange of shots that afternoon between the
men of the Beni Sira, and a troop of cavalry crossing from
Sus.&nbsp; This was a stopper over all, for it was evident we
could not force our way through a road winding by precipices,
held by a mountain tribe.&nbsp; Remembering the Arab proverb
which runs, &ldquo;Always ask counsel from your wife, but never
act on what she says,&rdquo; I held a long palaver with Haj
Addee, Lutaif <a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>and my men, on what was best to do.&nbsp; Two courses
were now open to me, either to wheel about and follow the shore
road by Agadhir, or else to try the upper and more difficult pass
to Sus, which starts above Amsmiz.&nbsp; This place was situated
about two days&rsquo; journey further on, the pass, according to
all reports, took three good days to cross, and having crossed
it, we should still be a long day from Tarudant.</p>
<p>Lutaif had no opinion, and as the rest all counselled Agadhir,
except Haj Swani, who gave it his opinion that he would go
wherever I did, I &ldquo;opted&rdquo; for Amsmiz, arguing that to
turn back would certainly dishearten my companions, and if the
Howara had been fighting a week ago, they would be fighting
still, and thinking that even if taking the upper road I failed,
I should see more of the interior of the Atlas, than I was likely
to do by any other route.&nbsp; After having cursed the Beni Sira
thoroughly in all the languages we knew, drank gallons of green
tea, sat for an hour or two listening to stories of the Djinoun,
smoked cigarettes and Kiff, and generally tried to imagine we
were not disappointed, we retired to bed, so as before first
light to be upon the road.&nbsp; Our bedroom had no window, and
gave on the <i>al fresco</i> drawing room I have referred to; all
round the walls were little recesses in which to put things, made
in the thickness of the wall, pouches and powder horns hung from
goats&rsquo; horns forced underneath the thatch, three long
&ldquo;jezails,&rdquo; all hooped with silver, one with a Spanish
two-real piece, depending from the trigger-guard, stood in the
corner, a lantern made of tin with coloured glass, gave a red
light, upon the floor of mud a Rabat carpet in pattern like a
kaleidoscope or Joseph&rsquo;s coat, was spread; nothing of
European manufacture was there except a large-sized (navy
pattern) Smith and Wesson pistol, which, hanging by a red worsted
cord upon the wall, seemed to project the shadow of the cross
upon the room.</p>
<h2><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>CHAPTER IV.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">My</span> journey all next day lay through
low hills of reddish argillaceous earth, cut into gullies here
and there by the winter rains, and clothed with sandaracs, Suddra
(Zizyphus lotus) and a few mimosas.&nbsp; The hills sloped
upwards to the wall-like Atlas, and on the left the
desert-looking plain of Morocco, broken but by the flat-topped
hill known as the Camel&rsquo;s Neck (Hank el Gimel), and bounded
by the mountains above Demnat, and the curve the Atlas range
makes to the north-east so as to almost circle round Morocco
city.&nbsp; We search our hearts, that is, I search my own and
the others&rsquo; hearts and try to persuade myself that we have
acted prudently in not attempting the Imintanout road.&nbsp; But
when did prudence console anybody?&nbsp; Rashness at times may do
so, but the prudent generally (I think) are more or less ashamed
of the virtue they profess.&nbsp; The Moors, of course, were glad
we had risked nothing, for though no cowards when the danger
actually presents itself, indeed, in many cases (as at the
battles with the Spaniards in 1861) showing more desperate
courage than anyone except the Soudanese, still they are so
imaginative, or what you please, that if men talk of danger they
will take a five days&rsquo; journey to avoid the places where
hypothetic peril lurks.&nbsp; Mohammed el Hosein, being in his
character of ex-slave dealer, what the French call a
&ldquo;lapin,&rdquo; talked of his adventures in the past, told
how he had smuggled slaves into the coast towns almost before the
Christian consul&rsquo;s eyes, sung <a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>Shillah songs in a high, quavering
falsetto, and boasted of his prowess in the saddle, occasionally
bursting into a suppressed chuckle at the idea of taking a
Christian into Tarudant.</p>
<p>Almost before we were aware of it, on going down a slope
between some bushes, we found ourselves right in the middle of a
crowded market.&nbsp; These country markets are a feature of
Morocco, and, I think, of almost every Arab country.&nbsp; Often
they are held miles away from any house, but generally on an
upland open space with water near.&nbsp; When not in use they
reminded me of the &ldquo;rodeos,&rdquo; on to which the Gauchos,
in La Plata, used to drive their cattle to count, to mark, part
out, or to perform any of the various duties of an
&ldquo;estanciero&rsquo;s&rdquo; <a name="citation97"></a><a
href="#footnote97" class="citation">[97]</a> life.&nbsp; The
markets usually are known by the day of the week on which they
are held, as Sok el Arba, Sok el Thelatta, el Jamiz, and so
forth; the Arabs using Arba, Tnain, Thelatta, &ldquo;one, two,
three&rdquo; etc., to designate their days.&nbsp; This market, in
particular, I knew to be the Sok es Sebt, but thought we had been
some distance from it, and all my assurance was required to make
my way amongst at least two thousand people with the dignity
which befits a Moorish gentleman upon a journey.&nbsp; Arabs and
Berbers, Jews and Haratin (men of the Draa province, of mixed
race) were there, all talking at the fullest pitch of strident
voices, all armed to the teeth.&nbsp; Ovens with carcases of
sheep roasting entire inside them, cows, camels, lines of small
brown tents made to be packed upon a mule and called
&ldquo;Kituns,&rdquo; dust, dust, and more dust, produced the
smell, as of wild beasts, which emanates from Eastern
crowds.&nbsp; Moors from Morocco city in white fleecy haiks I
carefully avoided, as being my equals in supposititious rank, <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>and,
therefore, likely to address me.&nbsp; Berbers in striped brown
rags, and wrapped in the curious mantle, called an
&ldquo;achnif&rdquo; in Shillah, made of black wool with fringes
and an orange-coloured eye, about two feet in length, woven into
the back, abounded; through them I shoved my horse, not even
looking down when the poor fellows lifted my cloak and kissed the
hem, and, passing through majestically, I heard some mutter,
&ldquo;That Sherif is very proud for one so thin,&rdquo; fat
being amongst Moors a sign of wealth, as it was evidently amongst
the Jews, if we are to take the testimony of the Old Testament as
worthy of belief.</p>
<p>To ride right through a market and pass on would have looked
suspicious, as markets in Morocco form a sort of medium for
exchange of news, in the same manner that in old times the
churchyard was a kind of club; witness the story of the elder who
was heard to say&mdash;&ldquo;he would not give all the sermons
in the world for five good minutes of the churchyard
clash.&rdquo;&nbsp; So, after having gone about a quarter of a
mile, we got under some olive trees (zeitun, from whence the
Spanish aceituna, an olive), and, sitting in the shade, sent
Swani to the market to buy some &ldquo;Schwah,&rdquo; that is,
some of the carcase of a sheep roasted whole &ldquo;en
barbecue.&rdquo;&nbsp; Various poor brothers in Mohammed came to
assure themselves of my complete good health; but Mohammed el
Hosein informed them the Sherif was ill, and, giving them some
copper coins, they testified to the existence of the one God, and
hoped that He might in His mercy soon make me well.&nbsp; Being
schooled as to the form to be observed, I looked up slowly, and,
raising one hand, muttered as indistinctly as I could that God
was great, and that we all were in His hands.&nbsp; This pleased
Mohammed el Hosein so much that when we were alone he assured me
I must have been born a Sherif, and could I but speak Arabic a
little less barbarously that our journey would <a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>have been
productive, as Sherifs make it a practice, whilst giving small
copper to the poor, to cadge upon their own account from the
better classes, of course for Allah and His Holy Prophet&rsquo;s
sake.&nbsp; Lutaif, who in his character of Syrian, talked almost
incessantly to anyone we met, elicited that this particular
market called &ldquo;Sok es Sebt,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Sixth Day
Market,&rdquo; is one of four held in Morocco on a Saturday, thus
showing that the Jews have got most of the trade into their
hands, and do not care that markets should be held upon their
holy day.&nbsp; We tore the &ldquo;Schwah&rdquo; between our
fingers, in the &ldquo;name of God&rdquo;; it tasted much like
leather cooked in suet; we passed the ablutionary water over our
hands, moving them to and fro to dry, drank our green tea, and
were preparing for a siesta when it was rumoured that an English
Jew was soon expected to arrive.&nbsp; Having still less
acquaintance with Yiddish than with Arabic, and being certain
that the English Israelite would soon detect me, and fall on one
shoulder exclaiming &ldquo;S&rsquo;help me, who would have
thought of meeting a fellow-countryman out &rsquo;ere!&rdquo; I
saddled up and started as majestically as I felt I could upon my
way.&nbsp; The start was most magnificent, Swani and Mohammed
helping to arrange my clothes when I had clambered to my seat,
and all went well with the exception that no one happening to
hold Lutaif&rsquo;s off stirrup, and the huge Moorish mule
saddle, called a &ldquo;Sirijah,&rdquo; being so slackly girthed,
that it is almost impossible to scale it all alone, he fell into
the dust, and Ali coming up to help with a broad grin received a
hearty &ldquo;Jejerud Din!&rdquo; (&ldquo;Curse your
religion!&rdquo;), which caused a coolness during the remainder
of the journey.&nbsp; Lutaif, though a good Christian and as
pious as are most dwellers on the Lebanon, yet came from the
country where, as Arabs say, &ldquo;the people all curse
God,&rdquo; referring to the imprecation <a
name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>on their
respective creeds, which is most faithfully taken and received
between Maronite and Druse, Christian and Moslem, and all the
members of the various jarring sects who dwell under the shadow
of the cedars on those most theologic hills.&nbsp; Nestling into
the gorges of the hills, and crowning eminences, were scattered
villages of the true Atlas type, built all of mud, flat roofed,
the houses rising one over the other like a succession of
terraces or little castles, and being of so exactly the same
shade as the denuded hills on which they stand as to be almost
impossible to make out till you are right upon them.&nbsp; At
times so like is village to hill, and hill to village, that I
have taken an outstanding mound of earth to be a house, and many
times have almost passed the village, not seeing it was
there.</p>
<p>Riding along and dangling my feet out of the stirrups to make
the agony of the short stirrup leather, hung behind the girths,
endurable, it struck me what peaceful folks the Arabs really
were.&nbsp; Here was a traveller almost totally unarmed, for the
Barcelona and Marseilles &ldquo;snap-haunces&rdquo; we had
borrowed at the Palm-Tree House were hardly to be called
offensive weapons; without a passport, travelling in direct
defiance of the Treaty of Madrid, in Arab clothes, asserting that
he was an Arab or a Turk (as seemed convenient).&nbsp; So,
unattended, for defensive purposes, I rode along quite safely, or
relatively safely, except from all the risks that wait upon the
travellers in any country of the world, such as arise from
stumbling horses and the like, fools, and the act of God.</p>
<p>What was it that stopped a band of Arabs on the lookout for
plunder?&nbsp; What stood between us and a party of the
&ldquo;Noble Shillah race&rdquo;?&nbsp; Either or both could
easily have plundered us and thrown our bodies into some silo and
no one would have known.&nbsp; The truth is, in Morocco, when one
reflects upon the inconveniences of the country, the lonely
roads, the places apparently <a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>designed by Providence to make men
brigands, and the fact that almost every Arab owns a horse and is
armed at least with a stout knife, that the inhabitants are
either cowardly to a degree, are law-abiding to a fault, or else
deprived by nature of initiative to such extent as to be quite
Arcadian in the foolish way in which they set about to rob.&nbsp;
When I remembered Mexico not twenty years ago, before Porfirio
Diaz turned the brigands, who used to swarm on every road, into
paid servants of the Government, men on a journey from the Rio
Grande to San Luis Potosi all made their wills and started
weighted down with Winchesters, pistols and bowie-knives, besides
a stout machete stuck through their saddle-girths.&nbsp; So
Morocco seemed to me a perfect paradise.</p>
<p>In the republic of the Eagle and the Cactus, the tramways
running to the bullfights at Tacubaya frequently were held up by
armed horsemen and the passengers plundered of everything they
had about them.&nbsp; Stage coaches often were attacked by
&ldquo;road agents&rdquo; and everyone inside of them stripped
naked, although the robbers, being caballeros, generally
distributed some newspapers amongst them to cover up their
nakedness.&nbsp; In the old monarchy, murder was pretty frequent,
but it was chiefly the result of private vengeance, and though
the tribes fought bloody battles now and then, a travelling
stranger seldom was molested by them, except he got in the
way.</p>
<p>Real highway robbery seemed not to flourish in Morocco,
perhaps because the atmosphere of monarchy was less congenial to
it than the free air of a republic, though that could surely not
have been the case, as virtue is a plant that grows from the top
downwards, and both the President and Sultan, at the time I write
about, are robbers to the core.</p>
<p>Occasionally in the Shereefian Empire, a Jew returning from a
fair was set upon and spoiled, and <a name="page102"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 102</span>now and then in lowered voices, as
you jogged along the road, were pointed out to you the place
where Haramin <a name="citation102a"></a><a href="#footnote102a"
class="citation">[102a]</a> had slain a man thirty or forty years
ago.</p>
<p>This is the case in all those portions of Morocco where
Christians travel; that is to Fez, to Tetuan, from Mazagan to the
city of Morocco, and generally about Tangier, the coast towns and
the Gharb. <a name="citation102b"></a><a href="#footnote102b"
class="citation">[102b]</a>&nbsp; Outside those spheres the case
is different; and in the Riff, the Sus, Wad Nun, or even a few
miles outside of Mequinez, a Christian&rsquo;s life, or even that
of a Mohammedan from India, Persia or the East, would not be
worth a &ldquo;flus.&rdquo; <a name="citation102c"></a><a
href="#footnote102c" class="citation">[102c]</a>&nbsp; We rested
for our mid-day halt upon the open plain under the shadow of a
great rock, the heat too great to eat, and passed the time
smoking and drinking from our porous water-jars, until the
&ldquo;enemy,&rdquo; as the Arabs call the Sun, sank down a
little; then in the cool we went on through a wilderness of
cactus and oleanders, almond and fig trees, with palms and
apricots, till sandy paths zigzagging between aloe hedges with a
few tapia walls backed by a ruined castle, betokened we were near
Asif-el-Mal.&nbsp; Asif means river in Shillah, and at the foot
of the crumbling walls a river ran, making things green and most
refreshing to the eyes after ten hours of fighting with the
enemy, enduring dust, and kicking at our animals after the
fashion which all men adopt upon a journey; not that it helps the
animals along, but seems to be a vent for the impatience of the
traveller.&nbsp; <a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>Norias <a name="citation103a"></a><a
href="#footnote103a" class="citation">[103a]</a> creak, a camel
with a donkey and a woman harnessed to one of them, water pours
slowly out of the revolving &ldquo;Alcuzas,&rdquo; <a
name="citation103b"></a><a href="#footnote103b"
class="citation">[103b]</a> and at the trough the maidens of the
village stand waiting to fill their water-jars, shaped like an
amphora, which they carry on the shoulders with a strap braced
round their hands.&nbsp; Asif-el-Mal boasts a Mellah, and Jews at
once came out to offer to trade with us, to talk, and hear the
news.&nbsp; Intelligent young Jews, Mois&eacute;s, Slimo, and
Mordejai with Baruch, and all the other names, familiar to the
readers of the Old Testament, flock round us.&nbsp; All can read
and write, can keep accounts, as well as if they had been born in
Hamburg; most have ophthalmia, some are good-looking, pale with
great black eyes, and every one of them seems to be fashioned
with an extra joint about the back.&nbsp; Yet hospitable, civil
and a link with Europe, which they have never seen; but about
which they read, and whose affairs they follow with the keenest
interest, all knowing Gladstone&rsquo;s name and that of
Salisbury; all longing for the day when they can put on European
clothes and blossom out arrayed after the gorgeous fashion of the
tribe in Mogador.&nbsp; Each of them wears a love-lock hanging
upon his shoulder, and, without doubt, if they were but a little
bit more manly-looking, they would be as fine young men as you
could wish to see.</p>
<p>Their race almost controls the town, Berbers are few and
hardly any Arabs but the Sheikh and his immediate following live
in the place.&nbsp; A proof the land is good, the soil
productive, and the water permanent; for when did Jews set up
their tabernacles on an unproductive soil, in a poor town, or
follow the <a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>fortunes of any one who was not rich?&nbsp; Their
chief, Hassan Messoud, a venerable man, dressed in a long blue
gown, a spotted belcher pocket-handkerchief over his head and
hanging down behind in a most unbecoming style, advanced to greet
us.&nbsp; Perhaps he was the finest Eastern Jew I ever saw; a
very Moses in appearance, as he might have been on Sinai a little
past his prime, and yet before the ingratitude of those he served
had broken him.&nbsp; Beside him walks his daughter, a Rebecca,
or Zohara, bearing fresh butter in a lordly tin dish, and bread
baked upon pebbles, with the impression of the stones upon the
underside.&nbsp; Such bread the chosen people have left in Spain,
and still in Old Castille amongst the &ldquo;Cristianos
Rancios,&rdquo; who hate the very name of Jew, and think that the
last vestige of their customs has long left Spain, the self-same
bread is eaten at Easter, if I remember rightly; and so, perhaps,
the true believer (Christian this time) unwittingly bakes bread
which yet may damn him black to all eternity.</p>
<p>Hassan comes quickly into the tent, and bids us welcome in
Jewish Arabic; and waiting cautiously till even our own Moors
have left the tent, breaks into Spanish and asks me of what
nationality I am.&nbsp; I tell him from &ldquo;God&rsquo;s
country,&rdquo; and he says, &ldquo;Ingliz,&rdquo; to which I
answer, &ldquo;Yes, or Franciz, for both are one.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
grins, squatting close to the door of the tent, servile, but
dignified, full six feet high, his black beard turning grey, and
hands large, fat, and whitish, and which have never done hard
work.&nbsp; We talk, and then Hassan takes up his parable.&nbsp;
Glory to Allah he is rich, and all the Governors are his dear
friends, that is they owe him money; and as he talks the old-time
Spanish rhyme comes to my memory, which, talking of some Jews who
came to see a certain king, speaks of their honeyed words, and
how they praised their people and boasted of their might.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Despues vinieron Don Salomon y Don
Ezequiel,<br />
Con sus dulces palabras parecen la miel,<br />
Hacen gran puja, de los de Israel.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>And
yet Hassan was but easy of dispense, wearing the clothes of an
ordinary Morocco Jew, with nothing to indicate his wealth.</p>
<p>As we sat talking to him of the exchange in Europe; about the
Rothschilds, Sassoons, Oppenheims, and others of the
&ldquo;chosen&rdquo; who bulk largely in the money columns of the
daily press of Europe (all of whom he knew by name), and
interchanging views about the late Lord Beaconsfield, whom Hassan
knew as Benjamin ben Israel, the daughters of God&rsquo;s folk
came out upon the house-tops, dressed in red and yellow, with
kerchiefs on their heads, eyes like the largest almonds, lips
like full-blown pomegranates, and looked with pride upon their
headman talking to the Sherif or Christian Caballer, whichever he
might be, on equal terms.&nbsp; Strange race, so intellectual, so
quick of wit, so subtle, and yet without the slightest dignity of
personal bearing; handsome, and yet without the least attraction,
conquering the Arabs as they conquer Saxons, Latins, or all those
with whom they come in contact upon that modern theatre of
war&mdash;the Stock Exchange.&nbsp; Hassan Messoud having
protested that by the God of Abraham we were all welcome, retired
and left us to pitch our tent upon a dust-heap in a courtyard,
between some ruined houses and the village wall.</p>
<p>Under the moonlight, the distant plain looked like a vast,
steely-blue sea, the deep, red roads all blotted out, the palms
and olives standing up exactly as dead stalks of corn stand up in
an October wheat-field.&nbsp; The omnipresent donkeys and camels
of the East hobbled or straying in the foreground beneath the
walls, and the mysterious, silent, white-robed figures wandering
about like ghosts, the town appeared to me to look as some
Morisco village must have looked in Spain when the Mohammedans
possessed the land, and villages brown, ruinous, and hedged about
with cactus <a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>like Asif-el-Mal, clung to the crags, and nestled in
the valleys of the Sierra de Segura, or the Alpujarra.</p>
<p>At daybreak, Hassan Messoud appeared with breakfast at our
tent, olives and meat in a sauce of oil and pepper, not
appetising upon an empty stomach, but not to be refused without
offence.&nbsp; Then, throwing milk upon the ground from a small
gourd, he blessed us, and invoked the God of Israel to shield us
on our way.&nbsp; A worthy, kindly, perhaps usurious, but most
hospitable Israelite, not without guile (or property), a type of
those Jews of the Middle Ages from whom Shakespeare took Shylock,
and in whose hands the lords, knights, squires, and men-at-arms
were as a Christian stockbroker, cheat he as wisely as he can, is
to-day in the hands of any Jew who, a few months ago, retailed
his wares in Houndsditch; but who, the Exchange attained to,
walks its precincts as firmly as it were Kodesh, and he a priest
after the order of Melchizedec.&nbsp; Riding along the trail
which runs skirting the foothills of the Atlas, and forces us to
dive occasionally into the deep dry &ldquo;nullah,&rdquo; for
there are only six or seven bridges in all Morocco, and none near
the Atlas, the vegetation changes, and again we pass dwarf
rhododendrons, arbutus, and kermes-oak, and enter into a zone of
plants like that of southern Spain, with the exception that here
the mignonette becomes a bush, and common golden rod grows four
feet high, with a thick woody stem.&nbsp; White poplars, walnuts,
elms, and a variety of ash are planted round the houses.&nbsp;
From the eaves hang strings of maize cobs; bee-hives like those
the Moors left in Spain, merely a hollow log of wood, or roll of
cork, lie in the gardens; grape vines climb upon the trees,
producing grapes, long, rather hard, claret-coloured, and
aromatic, the best, I think, in all the world, and which have
fixed themselves upon the memory of my palate, as have the
oranges of Paraguay.</p>
<p><a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 107</span>About
mid-day, upon a little eminence, we sight the tower of the
Kutubieh, the glory of Morocco; but the city is, so to speak,
hull down, and the white tower seems to hang suspended in the air
without foundations; indeed, it looks so thin at the great
distance from which we see it, as to be but a mere white line
standing up in the plain and pointing heavenwards, that is, if
towers built by false prophets do not point to hell.&nbsp; All
day my horse, really the best I ever rode in all Morocco, had
been uneasy, wanting to lie down; so disregarding the advice of
Mohammed el Hosein to prick him with my knife and pray to God,
somewhat prosaically I got off, and, unsaddling him, found his
shoulder fearfully swollen, and understood how I came possessed
of a horse the like of which few Christians, even for money, get
hold of from a Moor.&nbsp; I saw at once he had a fistulous sore
right through the withers; incurable without an operation and a
long rest.&nbsp; Then I believed what Mohammed el Hosein had told
me, that the horse was from the other side of the Atlas and had
been used in ostrich-hunting, for a better and more fiery beast I
never rode, and though thin, rough, and in the worst condition,
had he been sound-backed, quite fit to carry me to Timbuctoo.</p>
<p>The Arabs have an idea upon a journey that a man should
dismount as seldom as he can.&nbsp; They say dismounting and
remounting tires the horse more than a league of road, they
therefore sit the livelong day without dismounting from their
seat.&nbsp; The Gauchos, on the contrary, say it helps a horse to
get off now and then and lift the saddle for a moment, loosening
the girth so that the air may get between the saddle and the
back.&nbsp; This the Moors hold to be anathema, and Spaniards,
Mexicans, and most horsemen of the south agree that the saddle
should not be shifted till the horse is cool, on pain of getting
a sore back.&nbsp; Who shall decide when horsemen disagree?&nbsp;
<a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 108</span>However,
the Gauchos all girth very tightly, and the Arabs scarcely draw
the girth at all, their saddles repose on seven (the number is
canonical) thick saddle cloths, and are kept in their place more
by the breastplate than the girth.&nbsp; It may be therefore
that, given the loose girth, short stirrup leathers, and their
own flowing clothes, personal convenience has more to do with the
custom of not getting off and on than regard for the welfare of
their beast.&nbsp; The Arabs in Morocco, though fond of horses,
treat them roughly and foolishly; at times they cram them with
unnecessary food, at times neglect them; their feet they almost
always let grow too long, their legs they spoil by too tight
hobbling, and if upon a journey their horse tires they ride him
till he drops.</p>
<p>Across the mountains and amongst the wilder desert tribes,
this is not so, and travellers all agree that the wild Arab
really loves his horse; but he has need of him to live, whereas
inside Morocco horses are used either for war or luxury, or
because the man who rides them cannot afford a mule.&nbsp; The
pacing mule, throughout North Africa, is as much valued as he was
in Europe in the Middle Ages, and commands a higher price than
any horse; yet whilst allowing that he is dogged as a
Nonconformist, on the road, sober and comfortable, to my eye, a
man wrapped in a white burnouse, perched on a saddle almost as
large as the great bed of Ware, looks fitter to be employed to
guard a harem than to enjoy the company of the houris
inside.&nbsp; Necessity (in days gone by) has often forced me to
ride horses with a &ldquo;flower&rdquo; <a
name="citation108"></a><a href="#footnote108"
class="citation">[108]</a> on their backs or with a sore which
rendered every step they made as miserable to me as it was hell
to them; but as on these occasions I rode either before an Indian
<a name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>Malon,
<a name="citation109a"></a><a href="#footnote109a"
class="citation">[109a]</a> or for the dinner of a whole camp, so
I at once determined that, notwithstanding any risk, I would
purvey me a new horse at the next stopping place.&nbsp; As it
turned out, the changing horses and the talk which ensued, as the
owner of the horse and I tried to deceive each other about our
beasts, was the occasion of my never reaching Tarudant.&nbsp; At
least I think so, and if it was, some better traveller will do
that which I failed in doing, write a much better book than any I
could write, and if he be a practical and pushful man spare
neither horses on the road, nor stint the public of one iota of
his &ldquo;facts,&rdquo; for to the pushful is the kingdom of the
earth.&nbsp; As to what sort of kingdom they have made of it, it
is beyond the scope of this poor diary to enquire.</p>
<p>We crossed the Wad el Kehra, and early in the afternoon tied
up our animals under a fig-tree, with a river running hard by, a
stubble field in front, and Amsmiz itself crowning a hill upon
our right.&nbsp; Amongst the &ldquo;algarobas,&rdquo; <a
name="citation109b"></a><a href="#footnote109b"
class="citation">[109b]</a> fig-trees and poplars, swallows flit,
having come south, or perhaps migrated north from some more
southern land.</p>
<p>At the entrance of the town stood the palace of the Kaid, an
enormous structure made of mud and painted light rose-pink, but
all in ruins, the crenellated walls a heap of rubbish, the
machicolated towers blown up with gunpowder.&nbsp; The Kaid, it
seems, oppressed the people of the town and district beyond the
powers of even Arabs and Berbers to endure; so they rebelled, and
to the number of twelve thousand besieged the place, took it by
storm, and tore it all to pieces to search for money in the
walls.</p>
<p><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 110</span>Most
people in Morocco if they have money, hide it in the walls of
their abode, but the Kaid of Amsmiz was wiser, and had sent all
his to Mogador.&nbsp; He fought to the last, then cutting all his
women&rsquo;s throats, mounted his favourite horse and almost
unattended &ldquo;maugre all his enemies, through the thickest of
them he rode,&rdquo; leaving his stores well-dressed with
arsenic, so that, like Samson in his fall, he killed more of his
enemies than in his life.&nbsp; To-day he is said to live in Fez,
greatly respected, a quiet old Arab with a fine white beard,
whose greatest pleasure is to tell his rosary.</p>
<p>Curious how little the Oriental face is altered by the storms
of life.&nbsp; I knew one, Haj Mohammed el &mdash;, &mdash;a
scoundrel of the deepest dye&mdash;who in his youth had poisoned
many people, had tortured others, assassinated several with his
own hand, and yet was a kindly, courteous, venerable gentleman,
whose hobby was to buy any eligible young girl he heard of, to
stock his harem.&nbsp; One day I ventured to remark that he was
getting rather well on in years to think of such
commodities.&nbsp; He answered; &ldquo;Yes, but then I buy them
as you Christians buy pictures&mdash;to adorn my house; by Allah,
my heirs will be the gainers by my mania.&rdquo;&nbsp; Yet the
man&rsquo;s face was quiet and serene, his eyes bright as a
sailor&rsquo;s, his countenance as little marred by wrinkles as
those one sees upon the Bishops&rsquo; benches in the House of
Lords; and as he stroked his beard, and told his beads, he seemed
to me a patriarch after the type of those depicted in the Old
Testament.&nbsp; Perhaps it is the lack of railways, with their
clatter, smoke, and levelling of all mankind to the most common
multiple; but still it is the case&mdash;an Eastern
scoundrel&rsquo;s face is finer far than that a Nonconformist
Cabinet Minister displays, all spoiled with lines, with puckers
round the mouth, a face in which you see all natural passion
stultified, <a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
111</span>and greed and piety&mdash;the two most potent factors
in his life&mdash;writ large and manifest.</p>
<p>An orange grove, backed by a cane-brake, with the canes
fluttering like flags, was near to us; cows, goats, and camels
roamed about the outskirts of the town, as in Arcadia&mdash;that
is, of course, the Arcadia of our dreams&mdash;or of
Theocritus.</p>
<p>Jews went and came, saluting every one, and being answered:
&ldquo;May Allah let you finish out your miserable life&rdquo;;
but yet as pleased as if they had been blessed.&nbsp; Their
daughters came, like Rebecca, to the well&mdash;all carrying
jars&mdash;unveiled, and yet secure, for in this land few Moors
cast eyes upon the daughter of a Jew.</p>
<p>Upon the ramparts, shadowy white-robed figures, with long
guns, go to and fro, guarding the town from hypothetic
enemies.&nbsp; Through an arch, between two palm-trees, the
Kutabieh rises, distant and slender, and the white haze around
its base shows where Marakesh lies.&nbsp; On every hedge are
blackberries and travellers&rsquo; joy; whilst a large
honeysuckle, in full flower, smells better than all Bucklersbury
in simple time; a jay&rsquo;s harsh cry sounds like the howl of a
coyote, and Europe seems a million miles away.&nbsp; In the
evening light, the footpaths, which cut every hill, shine out as
they had all been painted by some clever artist, who had diluted
violet with gold.</p>
<p>Nothing reminds one that within half a mile a town, in which
three thousand people live, is near, except the footpaths which
zigzag in and out, crossing the fields, emerging out of woods,
and intersecting one another, as the rails seem to do at Clapham
Junction.&nbsp; A fusillade tells that a Sherif from the Sus has
just arrived; all Amsmiz sally forth to meet him mounted upon
their best, charging right up to the Sherif, and firing close to
his horse&mdash;wheeling and yelling like Comanches&mdash;making
a picture <a name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
112</span>shadowy, fantastic, and unbelievable to one who but
three weeks ago had left a land of greys.&nbsp; The
Sherif&rsquo;s people open fire, and when the smoke clears off
the Sherif himself, mounted upon a fine white horse, rides slowly
forward, holding a green flag.&nbsp; The people fall into a long
line behind him, which, by degrees, is swallowed up under the
horse-shoe gateway of the town.&nbsp; Mohammed el Hosein, whom I
had sent to look out for a horse, appears with a little,
undersized, and brachycephalic Shillah, leading a young, black
horse, unshod, with feet as long as coops, in good condition and
sound in wind and limb, and with an eye the blackest I have seen
in mortal horse&mdash;a sign of perfect temper; incontinently I
determine in my mind to buy him at all cost.&nbsp; We praise our
horses&mdash;that is, the Shillah praises his&mdash;but I, as a
Sherif, am far too grand to do so at first hand; so Swani lies
like a plumber about mine&mdash;which stands and kicks at flies,
and looks&mdash;like horses do when one is just about to part
with them&mdash;much more attractive than one ever thought
before.</p>
<p>The Shillah leads up his horse, which I pretend hardly to
notice; and, luckily for me, he speaks no Arabic.&nbsp; Then he
looks at my horse, and, I imagine, grabs him, for Swani springs
upon the horse&rsquo;s back, and runs him <i>ventre &agrave;
terre</i> over the rough stubble, and, stopping with a
jerk&mdash;the horse&rsquo;s feet cutting the ground like
skates&mdash;gets off, and says that, help him, Allah, the horse
is fit for Lord Mohammed, and that I only sell him because I am
so tender-hearted about the sore upon his back.</p>
<p>This makes the Shillah think there is a &ldquo;cat shut up
inside,&rdquo; <a name="citation112"></a><a href="#footnote112"
class="citation">[112]</a> for no one sells a horse for a sore
back amongst his tribe.&nbsp; We try his horse&mdash;that is,
Mohammed el Hosein makes him career about the field <a
name="page113"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 113</span>without a
bridle; and then I mount him, and display what I consider
horsemanship.&nbsp; Nine dollars and the horse?&nbsp; By Allah,
seven; but the Shillah, who has not tried my horse, looks at his
colt, and says: &ldquo;I brought him up, fed him with
camel&rsquo;s milk, rode him to war, and he is six years old;
nine dollars and the horse.&rdquo;&nbsp; We shake our heads; and
he, mounting his horse, yells like a Pampa Indian, and charging
through the cane-brake bare-backed, and with nothing but a string
on one side of his horse&rsquo;s neck, rushes up a steep bank and
disappears, riding like a Numidian.&nbsp; I say it was a pity I
did not give the nine, but am assured all is not over, and that
the man has probably gone to bring back &ldquo;a
bargain-striker&rdquo; to complete the sale.&nbsp; Throughout
Morocco, when animals change hands, the bargaining lasts
sometimes for a week; and at the last a man appears, sometimes a
passer-by, who is pressed into the undertaking, who, seizing on
the bargainers&rsquo; right hands, drags them together, and
completes the deal.</p>
<p>In about half-an-hour our man comes back, bringing the local
&ldquo;Maalem,&rdquo; that is Smith, who talks and talks, and as
he talks surveys me from the corner of his eye.&nbsp; At last the
Shillah yields, takes the seven dollars, counts them with great
attention, tapping each one of them upon a stone to see if
&ldquo;it speaks true,&rdquo; and then mounting my horse essays
its paces.&nbsp; As it fell out the horse, which galloped like a
roe, with Swani, set off with a plunge which almost sent the
Shillah over one side, and turning flew to the mules and stopping
by them refused to move a step.&nbsp; The Shillah thought, of
course, he had been done, and I had most reluctantly to mount the
horse and make him go.&nbsp; We give our word the horse is not a
jibber, and swear by Allah if he is, and the Shillah will send
him back to Mogador, he shall receive his money and his own horse
on our return.</p>
<p><a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>He
takes our word at once and grasps my hand, puts his own bridle on
my horse, and bending down kisses his own horse underneath the
neck, and says, in Shillah, that he hopes I shall never ill-treat
it, I promise (and perform) and bid my own horse farewell after
my fashion, and the Shillah mounts and rides out of my life
towards the town.&nbsp; A little dour and fish-eyed, turbanless
and ragged man, legs bowed from early riding, face marked with
scars, a long, curved knife stuck through a greasy belt, hands on
a horse as if they came from heaven; his farewell to his horse
was much more real than is the leavetaking of most men from their
wives, and moved me to the point of being about to call him back
and break the bargain, had I not reflected that the pang once
over, the poor Shillah would never in his life be at the head of
so much capital. <a name="citation114"></a><a href="#footnote114"
class="citation">[114]</a></p>
<p>In less than half-an-hour the Maalem had shod the horse,
shortening its feet with an iron instrument shaped like a trowel,
and nailing on the shoes, which almost cover the whole foot, with
home-made nails; he stays to guard our animals (and spy upon us),
and we prepare for our first al fresco night.</p>
<p>Unlike America, where travellers sleep out of doors from
Winnipeg to Patagonia, in the East, except in crossing deserts,
to sleep out of doors without a tent is quite exceptional, and
yet one never sleeps so soundly as on a fine night beside a fire,
one&rsquo;s head upon a saddle, feet to the fire, and the stars
to serve as clock.&nbsp; Even the wandering Arabs generally carry
tents, and thus, in my opinion, all through the East much of the
charm of camping out is lost.&nbsp; All that we do is a
convention, and Arabs are not savages, <a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 115</span>but on the
contrary even the Bedouins are highly civilised after their
fashion, and the civilised man must always have a roof, even of
canvas, over his head to shut out nature.&nbsp; Not but that your
common Moors, like to &ldquo;your Kerne of Ireland&rdquo; in
ancient days, do not sleep out, for nothing is more common than
on a rainy night, in camping at a village, for the Sheikh to send
a guard to watch a traveller&rsquo;s horses, and for the guard to
&ldquo;liggen in their hoods&rdquo; all the night long.&nbsp; So
at Amsmiz, under a fig tree, I made my camp, despite the protests
of Lutaif, the Maalem, <a name="citation115"></a><a
href="#footnote115" class="citation">[115]</a> and Mohammed el
Hosein, who joined in saying that it was not decent for a man of
my (Moorish) position to camp outside the town.&nbsp; Swani
himself was rather nervous, and, as it turned out, there may have
been some risk, for a strong &ldquo;war-party,&rdquo; as they
would say upon the frontiers in America, drove almost every head
of cattle belonging to the town that very night.&nbsp; We slept
as sound as door-mice, and the Maalem, who kept watch with an old
muzzle-loading rifle stamped with the Tower mark, slept like a
top, knowing the duty of a most ancient guard, for during the
night I thought I heard a noise of people passing, and waking saw
him fast asleep with the old rifle by his side full cocked, and
with a bunch of rushes in its muzzle either for safety or for
some other reason not made plain.&nbsp; Darwin relates the
peculiar and ineffaceable impression a night he slept under the
stars, upon the Rio Colorado, in Patagonia, made on him.&nbsp; He
says the cold blue-looking sky, the stars, the silence, the dogs
keeping watch, the horses feeding tied to their picket pins, and
the sense of being cut off from all mankind, appealed to him more
than the beauty of the tropics, the grandeur of the Andes, or
anything <a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>that he remembered in his travels.&nbsp; And he was
right.&nbsp; Nothing appeals to civilised and to uncivilised
alike so much as a fine night when one sleeps near one&rsquo;s
horse, and wakes occasionally to listen to the noises of the
night.&nbsp; Men from the counter, from the university, riff-raff
of towns cast out like dross into a frontier territory, all feel
the spell.&nbsp; The Indians and the Arabs feel it, but do not
know exactly what they feel; still, in a house, under a roof,
they pine for something which I am certain is the open air at
night.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis said some ancient wise philosopher once took an
Indian from the southern Pampa and showed him all the delights,
the pomps and vanities, of Buenos Ayres: showed him the theatre
with Christian girls dancing half naked, took him to Mass at the
cathedral, led him along the docks, let him fare sumptuously, and
then accompanied him to gaze upon the multifarious faces of
strange women, who used to lean from almost every balcony and
beckon to the stranger in that town; and then the Indian, fed,
instructed, with his mind enlarged by all the pomp and
circumstance of a Christian town, was asked to say if he liked
Buenos Ayres or the Pampa best.&nbsp; The story goes that, after
pondering a while, the Indian answered: &ldquo;Buenos Ayres very
large, beautiful things, very wonderful, Christian women kind to
poor Indian, but the Pampa best.&rdquo;&nbsp; A brutish answer of
a brute mind.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis patent that the man was quite
incapable of understanding all he saw; no doubt our gospel truths
were all unknown to him, the philosopher who took him round to
haunts of low debauchery either a fool or knave; but on the other
hand, riddle me this: how many men of cultivation, education, and
the rest have seen the Pampa, prairie, desert, or the steppes,
and putting off the shackles of their bringing-up, stayed there
for life, and become Indians, Arabs, Cossacks, or Gauchos; but
who ever saw an Indian, Arab, or wild man of <a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>any race
come of his own accord and put his neck into the noose of a
sedentary life, and end his days a clerk?</p>
<p>And so of faiths.&nbsp; The missionary for all his preaching
would never mark a sheep, had he but gospel truths alone to draw
upon.&nbsp; What brings the savage to the fold is interest, guns,
cotton cloth, rum, tea, sugar, coffee, and the thousand things
for which a commentator might search the Scriptures through from
end to end and not find mentioned.&nbsp; In Central Africa the
Christian and the Moslem missionary are both at work marking
their sheep as fast as may be, and each one as much convinced as
is the other of the justice of his cause.&nbsp; With a fair
field, without the adventitious aids of Christian goods, the
Moslem wins hands down.</p>
<p>The Christian comes and says &ldquo;My negro friends, believe
in Christ,&rdquo; and the poor negro, always eager to believe in
anything, assents, and then the Christian sets him to black his
boots, and all that negro&rsquo;s life he never rises to an
equality with his converter.&nbsp; Then comes the Mussulman and
cries &ldquo;Only one God.&rdquo;&nbsp; The fetish worshipper who
has had a dozen all his life, thinks it a little hard to give
them up, but does so, becomes a Moslem, and is eligible to be
Sultan, Basha, Vizier, Kaid, Sheikh, or what not; so that, put
rum and rifles on one side, let preaching be the test, in fifty
years from the Lake Chad to Cape Town there would not be a single
negro, except a few who stuck to their old gods, outside
Islam.</p>
<p>I slept but fitfully, knowing if I could leave Amsmiz without
suspicion that I was sure to reach my journey&rsquo;s end.&nbsp;
The night wore on, the sapphire sky changing to steely-blue; as
the muezzin called at the Feyer, <a name="citation117"></a><a
href="#footnote117" class="citation">[117]</a> great drops of dew
hung from the leaves; up from <a name="page118"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 118</span>the river rose the metallic croaking
of the frogs; Canopus was just setting; across the sky, the
mirage of the dawn stole stealthily, the mules stood hanging down
their heads upon the picket rope, a jackal howled somewhere far
out upon the plain; Allah perhaps looked down, and not far off
from me baited quite peacefully my (new) destrere on
&ldquo;herbes fine and good.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Pleasing</span> to wake up under the fig
trees with all our cloaks and blankets wet with dew, to find our
guard, the Maalem, still sound asleep, and be accosted by a
tracker who informed us that many of the cattle of the town had
been driven off the night before, and who would hardly believe
that all our animals were safe.&nbsp; Soon parties from the town,
armed and muffled up in cloaks against the morning air, rode out
from underneath the horseshoe gateway, and spread in all
directions, trying to strike the trail of the &ldquo;mad
herdsmen,&rdquo; as they were called along the Highland Border in
the days before prosperity had rendered Scotland the home of
commonplace.</p>
<p>Though sharp of eye, it did not strike me that the Arabs and
Shillah were experienced trackers.&nbsp; They rode about too
much, and must have crossed the trail of the lost cattle a
hundred times, and I kept thinking that an
&ldquo;Arribe&ntilde;o&rdquo; <a name="citation119"></a><a
href="#footnote119" class="citation">[119]</a> from the River
Plate would have done better work than the whole tribe.&nbsp;
Still, as they scattered on the hills, their white clothes just
appearing now and then behind the clumps of trees, as they
quartered all the ground, they fell effectively into the middle
distance, and no doubt if they never found their cattle, on the
first fine night they would recoup themselves from some
neighbouring village in the hills.&nbsp; Cattle and
horse-stealing, with an occasional higher flight into the regions
of <a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>abduction of young girls, seem to be staple industries
in all pastoral countries, and nowhere but in western Texas are
taken very seriously; but there the horse-thief hangs.&nbsp;
Camped once outside a village called Bel-arosis, on the road from
Tangier to Rabat, a raiding party attacked the place upon a rainy
night, fought quite a lively action, the bullets coming through
my tent, drove off some horses and several yoke of oxen, and in
the morning the Kaid rode up on horseback, his followers behind
him, in just the spirit that a gentleman at home starts out to
hunt.&nbsp; He praised his God for his good luck, and said he
reckoned (by Allah&rsquo;s help) to retake all the
&ldquo;Creagh,&rdquo; and drive above a thousand dollars&rsquo;
worth of sheep, of cattle, and horses, from the weakest
neighbours of the nearest hostile tribe he met.</p>
<p>In all the actions that take place consequent upon these
cattle raids, but few are slain, for though both the Arabs and
the Berbers all have guns, their style of fighting is a survival
from the time they carried bows.&nbsp; They rarely charge, and
never engage hand-to-hand, but gallop to and fro and fire their
guns with both eyes shut, or, turning on their horses, fire over
the tail; so few are killed, except the prisoners, who generally
are butchered in cold blood, if they are not of such account as
to be worth a ransom.&nbsp; A merry, pleasant life enough for
able-bodied men, and not unhealthy, and one that makes them
singularly bad subjects for missionary work.&nbsp; So stony is
the ground in the vineyard of the tribes, that up to now I never
heard of any missionary so bold or foolish as to attempt to
dig.&nbsp; A day will come, no doubt, when their hearts will
prove more malleable; but I fear before that time their bodies
will have to be much wrought upon by rifles, revolvers, and the
other civilising agents which commonly precede the introduction
of our faith.</p>
<p><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>Leaving Amsmiz, the road to Sus leads over foothills
all of red argillaceous earth and fissured deeply here and there
by winter rains.&nbsp; Now and then strange effects of coloured
earth, blue, yellow, green, and mauve, diversify the scene.&nbsp;
The road leads through a straggling oak wood and emerges at a
village, where, in the middle, the county council is assembled in
a thatched mosque.&nbsp; Mosques serve for council chambers,
meeting places, and in villages for travellers to sleep in, for
throughout Morocco the sanctuary is never closed, and thus the
people feel their God is always there, and not laid up in
lavender for six days in the week.</p>
<p>The Maalem who had accompanied us as guide, and as a guarantee
that we were creditable folk&mdash;for in the wilder districts of
Morocco travellers take a man in every district to convoy them to
the next&mdash;had reached his limit, and, laying down his gun,
entered the mosque to get another man.&nbsp; What he said there I
do not know; if he had doubts perhaps he uttered them, at any
rate, after a most unseasonable wait, which kept us all on pins
and needles, he emerged, bringing a most ill-favoured tribesman,
who came up to me and, kissing my clothes, asked for my
blessing.&nbsp; I gave it him as well as I was able, but fancied
he was not satisfied, as he retired muttering in Shillah, of
which I did not understand a word.&nbsp; The Maalem bade us
good-bye, and asked for cartridges, which, of course, we gave,
but how they benefited him is a moot point, for they were
intended for a small-sized Winchester; he drew his charge and
crammed the four or five cartridges we gave him into his old
Tower gun, but as I did not pass by Amsmiz on my return, I have
no information how he fared when he touched off the piece.</p>
<p>Little by little the road got worse until we entered a
tremendous gorge, just like a staircase, which made the <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 122</span>worst roads
in the Sierra Morena look like Piccadilly by comparison.&nbsp;
Only a mule, an Iceland pony, or a horse bred in the mountain
districts of Morocco could have coped with such a road, and, as
it was, the efforts of the poor brutes were pitiable to
see.&nbsp; Under our feet, at a great depth below, the Wad el
N&rsquo;fiss boiled furiously amongst the stones, winding and
rewinding like a watch spring, and forcing us to cross it many
times, when its swift current proved so formidable that, although
not more than three feet deep, we had to enter altogether in a
group to keep our feet.&nbsp; As we were toiling up a steep
incline, a shouting brought our hearts into our mouths, and,
looking back, we saw two mountaineers rushing to intercept us,
from a neighbouring hill.&nbsp; No time for any consultation, or
to do more than cock our miserable guns and sit quite meekly
waiting for the worst.&nbsp; On came the mountaineers, bounding
from stone to stone till they appeared upon the road and blocked
our way.&nbsp; Long guns, curved daggers, and almost naked save
for their long woollen shirts, their side locks flying in the
wind, they looked most formidable, and poured out at once a
volume of guttural Shillah which sounded menacing.&nbsp;
Mohammed-el-Hosein, who with Ali the muleteer spoke Shillah,
interpreted to Swani, who, half in Arabic and half in Spanish
(which he called Turkish) informed me what they said.</p>
<p>It seemed the desperadoes wanted us to stop until a little boy
brought down some Indian corn and milk, for it appeared it was
the custom of those hills never to let a well-dressed Moor pass
without some little offering.&nbsp; Of course a poor man, or
anyone to whom the maize and milk would have been of great
service, passed by unnoticed, as in other lands.&nbsp; I
graciously assented, and in due course a boy appeared carrying a
wooden bowl, from which I drank and passed it to <a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>my
followers after the usual grace. <a name="citation123a"></a><a
href="#footnote123a" class="citation">[123a]</a>&nbsp; The
tribesmen would accept no money, but asked me to say a word for
them about their taxes, which were not paid, to their liege
lord.&nbsp; As might be expected of me I said I would, and should
have done so had I known who their lord was or where he lived, or
had I chanced to meet the lord in a more seasonable place.&nbsp;
Little by little we entered the zone of Arar trees (Callitris
Quadrivalvis) about which Hooker says: &ldquo;This tree has no
congener, its nearest ally being a South African genus of
Cupressus (Widdingtoniana).&rdquo; <a name="citation123b"></a><a
href="#footnote123b" class="citation">[123b]</a>&nbsp; Various
writers, as Shaw <a name="citation123c"></a><a
href="#footnote123c" class="citation">[123c]</a> and Daubeny, <a
name="citation123d"></a><a href="#footnote123d"
class="citation">[123d]</a> have attempted to identify this tree
with the &ldquo;<i>&Theta;&upsilon;&iota;&alpha;</i>,&rdquo; of
Theophrastus, and the Thyine Wood of the Apocalypse.&nbsp;
Daubeny makes both Martial and Lucian refer to it under the name
of Citrus, and Hooker is of opinion that the &ldquo;Citrea
mensa&rdquo; of Petronius Arbiter was made of Arar-wood.&nbsp; An
ingenious writer (Captain Cook, &ldquo;Sketches in Spain&rdquo;)
is almost certain that the roof of the Mosque of Cordova is of
Arar, because the Spaniards refer to it as being made of
Alerce.&nbsp; Alerce happens to mean larch in Spanish, but when
did a derivation hunter ever allow that the people of any country
really understood the meaning of words in their own paltry
language?&nbsp; It is perhaps well not to question too closely
the dogmas of science, and what prudent man would aver that
anything might not be found in the veracious pages of the
Apocalypse?</p>
<p>The Arars spread all over the mountains in a dense low scrub,
rarely attaining more than ten feet high, on account of the
frequent fires which the inhabitants <a name="page124"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 124</span>light in the spring to obtain
pasture for their goats and sheep.&nbsp; In an angle of the road
I passed four fine old trees, perhaps forty feet in height,
immensely branchy, and with trunks measuring possibly
two-and-a-half feet in diameter.&nbsp; In the glades between the
cedars patches of Indian corn were ripening; some was dead ripe,
but no one dared to gather it, for the Kaid of Kintafi, into
whose territory we now had passed, had issued orders that he
would give the signal for the harvest, and had not yet seen fit
to give the word.&nbsp; Well do the Spaniards say that,
&ldquo;fear, not walls protect the vineyard,&rdquo; <a
name="citation124"></a><a href="#footnote124"
class="citation">[124]</a> for not a house stood within several
miles of some of the maize patches and still not a head of corn
was touched.</p>
<p>The Kaid of Kintafi, who was destined to be my captor, had
some years before waged war with Muley-el-Hassan, the late Sultan
of Morocco.&nbsp; The Sultan had invaded the mountain territory
of Kintafi, and destroyed most of the villages, but not being
able to reduce the fortress of the Kaid had won him to his side
by offering him the hand of either his sister or his daughter,
and had departed after having brought the war to a conclusion, on
the peace-with-honour plan.&nbsp; The Kaid rendered him
henceforth a limited obedience, responding to his
overlord&rsquo;s demands for taxes, and for assistance in the
field when he thought fit, but taking care not to rebuild his
villages, so that the aforesaid overlord might find a desert
through which to pass if the fit took him to again commence
hostilities.&nbsp; El Kintafi, for after the Scottish fashion he
is designated territorially, is of the Berber race, and although
speaking Arabic he speaks it as foreigner.&nbsp; He is reckoned
one of the greatest chieftains of the Berber people in the
south.</p>
<p>Eight or nine months of drought had rendered the plain country
through which I passed up to Amsmiz <a name="page125"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 125</span>almost a desert, and it was pitiful
to see the people digging for a kind of earth-nut, locally known
as Yerna, white in colour and semi-poisonous till after many
washings.&nbsp; The plant I have not been able to identify, but
the leaves are something like one of the umbellifer&aelig;.&nbsp;
Hooker does not seem to notice it in his Botany of Morocco, and
perhaps, when he was in the south, famine had not forced the
people to dig for it, or the small thin leaves had all been
withered by the heat.</p>
<p>Crawling along the mountain roads I found myself trying to
estimate which of the two entailed most misery upon Mankind, the
old-time famine, which I saw going on all round me in Morocco,
caused by want of water and failure of the crops, or the
artificial modern and economic famine so familiar in all large
towns, where in the West End the rich die from a plethora of
food, and in the East End the poor exist just at subsistence
limit by continual work.&nbsp; No doubt, in modern towns, the
poor enjoy the blessings of improved sanitation, gas, and impure
water, laid on in insufficient quantities to every house; of
education, that is, illusory instruction to the fifth standard,
to fit them to drive carts and tend machines; but, on the other
hand, they have but little sun, either external or internal, in
their lives, and know their misery by the help of the education
which they pay for through the rates.</p>
<p>The sufferer by famine, as in Morocco, suffers enough, God
knows, stalks about like a skeleton, dies behind a saint&rsquo;s
tomb; but in the sun.&nbsp; He believes in Allah to the last, and
dies a man, his eyesight not impaired by watching wheels whirr
round to make a sweater rich, his hands not gnarled with useless
toil (for what can be more useless than to work all through your
life for some one else?), and his emaciated face still human, and
not made gnomish <a name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>by work, drink, and east wind, like the poor Christian
scarecrows of Glasgow, Manchester, and those accursed
&ldquo;solfataras,&rdquo; the Yorkshire manufacturing
towns.&nbsp; But place it where you will, either in tents, on
some oasis in the desert, wandering as the Indians used to wander
before America was but one vast advertisement for pills, or in
the sweaty, sooty noisy &ldquo;centre of industry,&rdquo; mankind
is made to suffer; so, perhaps, Tolstoi has the root of things
when he suggests that marrying, giving in marriage, and all
licensed or illegitimate propagation should cease, and man by
non-existence at last attain to bliss.</p>
<p>So in a pass between two walls of earth, with bands of shale
crossing them transversely, and roots of long dead Arars sticking
through the ground, I came upon the human comedy fairly played
out by representative marionettes of every age and sex.&nbsp;
First, the father, a fine old Arab, gaunt, miserable,
grey-headed, ragged, hollow-cheeked, without a turban, shoes, or
waist-belt, and carrying a child which looked over his shoulder,
with enormous black and starving eyes; the mother on foot, in
rags and shoeless, and still holding between her teeth a ragged
haik to veil her misery from the passer by, a baby at her back,
and in her hand a branch torn from an olive-tree to switch off
flies; then three ophthalmic children, with flies buzzing about
their eyelids; lastly, the eldest son stolidly sitting in despair
beside a fallen donkey carrying salt, and rubbed by girth, by
crupper, and by pack ropes, and an epitome of the last stage of
famine and of overwork.&nbsp; And as we came upon them, from a
saint&rsquo;s tomb near by, a quavering call to prayers rang out,
and the whole family fell to giving praise to him who sendeth
hunger, famine, withholds the rain, and shows his power upon the
sons of men, infidel or believer, Turk, Christian, Moor, and Jew,
with such <a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>impartiality that at times one thinks indeed that he is
God.&nbsp; As for the donkey; Bible, Koran, and all the rest of
sacred books were writ for man, and the galled jade may wince
until the end of time for all Jehovah, Allah, Obi, and the rest
of the Olympians seem to care.&nbsp; All our bread, dates, and
tea went to the owners of the donkey, and had I been in European
clothes I should have bought the starveling beast and put a
bullet through his head.</p>
<p>Cistus and heath, with mignonette, dwarf arbutus and stunted
algarrobas, with thyme and sweet germander, made a thick
underwood upon the hills; and yet, as is the case in all Morocco,
and, I think, everywhere throughout the East, footpaths crossed
here and there, men seemed to be eternally coming and going,
donkeys, more or less wretched in appearance, wandered here and
there, and in the air, above the scent of flowers, hung the
stench of human excrement, the &ldquo;bouquet
d&rsquo;Orient,&rdquo; the perfume which, I fancy, scents the
breeze in Araby the blest.</p>
<p>Along the desert trails, in the Sahara <a
name="citation127a"></a><a href="#footnote127a"
class="citation">[127a]</a> and the Soudan, I fancy, man is
rarely long unseen, and camels and donkeys must have been
struggling across the sands before the first instant of uselessly
recorded time.&nbsp; Still, as in India, wild beasts thrive
almost alongside cultivated fields, and in the sandy paths which
ran through the thick undergrowth tracks of wild boar appeared;
whilst, on the borders of the bare hills, above the vegetation,
&ldquo;moufflon&rdquo; <a name="citation127b"></a><a
href="#footnote127b" class="citation">[127b]</a> skipped, looking
so like to goats that I could scarcely credit they were wild.</p>
<p><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>All
the streams we crossed had whitish beds, and a white sediment
clung to the grass upon their banks.&nbsp; It seemed there was a
salt mine in the neighbourhood which supplied all the province,
and underneath us far below, looking like ants, we saw long
strings of mules and donkeys meandering along the paths towards
the mine.&nbsp; The road gradually got worse and worse, and in
few places averaged more than four feet wide, so that I rode one
stirrup brushing the mountain and in great terror that I should
lose my yellow slipper down the precipice, five or six hundred
feet in depth upon the other side, which went sheer down into the
Wad N&rsquo;fiss.&nbsp; Occasionally we had to call to trains of
mules advancing to stop till we could get into one of the hollows
scooped here and there into the hillside to allow the travellers
to pass.&nbsp; The mules in nearly every instance had their packs
covered up in the striped blankets made in Sus, and woven in a
pattern of alternate black and white bars, with fringed edges,
and curious cabalistic-looking figures in the corner of the
web.&nbsp; Now and again a Sheikh&rsquo;s house, perched upon a
hill and built like a castle, with turrets, battlements, and
Almenas, <a name="citation128"></a><a href="#footnote128"
class="citation">[128]</a> all in mud, and looking as like a
properly constituted fortalice as the difference of income of
their owners and that of the owners of the modern stucco
fortalice outside an English town permits.&nbsp; Along the road
one constant interchange of &ldquo;Peace be with you&rdquo; was
kept up, as we met other parties of believers going or coming
from the Sus, for the other two main highways being closed by the
outbreak of hostilities, all traffic had converged upon the road
which started from Amsmiz.</p>
<p><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>Rounding a corner and dipping down a steep incline,
almost before we were aware of it, we found ourselves between a
castle and a small mosque; all round the &ldquo;perron&rdquo;
which led to the gate groups of muleteers sat resting; by a side
door were lounging several attendants armed with long guns, the
barrels hooped with silver and with brass, and, to complete the
picture the Sheikh himself in shirt sleeves, so to speak, that
is, without a haik, and dressed in a long white garment, sat in
the shade studying the Koran.&nbsp; His air of patriarchal
simplicity so impressed me that only with an effort I remembered
that I too was one of the same faith, and rather rudely I fear,
according to Moorish ideas of etiquette, I mumbled a low
&ldquo;Peace be with you&rdquo; as I passed.&nbsp; From the
mosque windows and the door came out a sound of voices as of
children shouting all at once, it was the children of the place
learning to read, for amongst Arabs no place, however small, no
Duar of six tents, lost in some far, remote oasis of the Soudan,
is without its schoolmaster.&nbsp; About a league farther along
the road, and leaving the castle, which rejoiced in the
appellation of Taguaydirt-el-Bur, we got off under some oleander
and olive trees by the side of a clear stream to wash and
eat.</p>
<p>Mohammed-el-Hosein swears by Allah no infidel has ever seen
the place, and asks, if so, let him describe it.&nbsp; A thing
indeed which Maupassant himself could hardly have achieved
without inspection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me the signs of such a place&rdquo; is a common
Arab question if, in talking of some place, he doubts you have
been there.&nbsp; Most of the famous places in the Mohammedan
world are well known by description to all believers, and nothing
is more common than to hear one man &ldquo;giving the
signs&rdquo; of Mecca, Medinah, or some other holy spot with the
minuteness of a lady novelist describing scenery.&nbsp; As we sat
eating under our olive trees, people kept passing on the road <a
name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>continuously.&nbsp; Thus in the heart of one of the
most unknown ranges of mountains (to the Nazarene) in the whole
world, there is no solitude, no sense of loneliness in spite of
all the grandeur of the hills, the snow, the precipices and the
brawling streams.</p>
<p>Though I know no single Oriental country but Morocco, and that
is known to all Mohammedans as Mogreb-el-Acksa (the Far West) I
yet imagine that throughout the East the interest lies entirely
in mankind, for nature, at least to judge by what is seen
throughout Morocco, is as dominated by man as is the docile soil
of England, which gives its crop year in year out, suffers and
has endured a thousand years of ploughing, dunging, reaping,
draining, and the like, and thinks as little of rebellion as does
the mouthy Radical who on his cart thunders against the Queen,
and slavers doggishly before a new created lord.&nbsp; Still, for
a thousand (perhaps ten thousand) years the Oriental life has
altered little, nothing having been done to &ldquo;improve&rdquo;
the land, as the Americans ingenuously say.&nbsp; And so may
Allah please, bicycles, Gatling guns, and all the want of
circumstance of modern life not intervening, it may yet endure
when the remembrance of our shoddy paradise has fallen into
well-merited contempt.</p>
<p>Our local guide, a long, thin, scrofulous-looking Berber,
dressed in a single garment like a nightgown, but most
intelligent, said that close to where we sat, two hundred years
ago lived El Kalsadi, a writer on arithmetic.&nbsp; Casting about
the corners of my recollection I recalled having seen the name in
Quaritch&rsquo;s Catalogue of Arab books; thus Gentile, Jew, and
True Believer for once concurred about one circumstance.&nbsp; I
took my saddle cloth and under some oleanders by the stream fell
fast asleep, but fifty yards removed away from the men and
animals, and, waking, found two Berber tribesmen sitting near <a
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>to me
washing their feet.&nbsp; They turned upon my moving and said
something in their own tongue.&nbsp; I, not understanding, put on
a grave demeanour and answered, Allah, which seemed to satisfy
them as entirely as if I had been able to rejoin as St. Paul
advises, with my understanding; but no doubt, the gift of tongues
and all duly allowed for, he had often found himself similarly
situated when on the tramp.&nbsp; Just at the crossing of this
stream we paid and dismissed the guide who had accompanied us
from the wayside mosque; he straight departed by a road fit for
but partridges alone, across the hills, and I think somehow or
other in conjunction with the Maalem from Amsmiz, contrived to
pass the word along the road, of their opinion of my adherence to
the Christian faith.</p>
<p>Struggling along over the shingly bed of the Wad N&rsquo;fiss
for about two miles, we came again to a funnel-shaped gorge,
which led by degrees to a terrific staircase of rocks, known to
the local muleteers as N&rsquo;fad Abu Hamed, the Knees of Father
Hamed, as being so steep that no one could ascend it except upon
all fours, or from its effects, upon the knees of the unlucky
mules, or from some other reason as to which commentators have
disagreed.&nbsp; Just at the top I looked back over the finest
range of mountain scenery I remember to have seen, and thought
that with good luck and patriotism some few score Afridis in such
a place might hold in check a regiment of marauding Britishers,
but on reflection I saw clearly that the word patriotism was out
of place when used against ourselves.&nbsp; To the west towards
the Sus the mountains seemed to dip, and Ouichidan, the highest
peak in all the Southern Atlas, towered right above us a little
to the east of where we stood, whilst far away in the dim
distance rose the far distant mountains of the anti-Atlas, which
rise above the province of the <a name="page132"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 132</span>Draa, and on whose snow no Christian
has ever trod.&nbsp; Descending rapidly we passed a strath in
which some country people were engaged in burning down a tree, an
ancient poplar which the wind had partly shifted from its place,
and which, when it fell, must fall inevitably across the
road.&nbsp; In a small patch of Indian corn an aged negro was at
work, dressed all in white with a red fez, and illustrating (in
the middle distance) the mystery of creation in a fantastic
fashion of his own.</p>
<p>Stumbling and tripping, leading our exhausted beasts, we came
long after nightfall to a miserable house perched on a ledge of
rocks over a river, and with a garden between the hillside and
the stream; the place is called in Shillah, Imgordim.&nbsp;
Nothing was to be had either for love or money, and we went
supperless to bed save for green tea, sadly reflecting that had I
been a Moor indeed, food would have been obtainable, for I could
have sent a man to take it in the usual way, by force; and as it
was, perhaps the people thought me a fool for not following out
the course adopted by all respectable Sherifs when travelling
about.&nbsp; Throughout Morocco Sherifs, especially from Fez, are
a positive curse to the poorer class of Moors; for being
&ldquo;holy&rdquo; they behave exactly in the same way that the
two Jewish Sherifs Hophni and Phinehas behaved in Holy Writ; but
most unfortunately, the people are so unresisting, that
punishment which overtook their prototypes seldom is meted out to
them, and they pervade the land, begging and taking contributions
from the poor, for Allah&rsquo;s sake.&nbsp; One of the really
wise laws the French have made in Algeria is that forbidding the
Sherifs to go round sorning on the people.&nbsp; Imagine if
religion had the same hold in England as it has in Morocco, and
recognised descendants of St. Paul <a name="citation132"></a><a
href="#footnote132" class="citation">[132]</a> <a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>perambulated up and down, taking by force when the
faithful were disinclined to give, and you may have an inkling of
how onerous the burden was upon the poorer villages before the
French put down the practice in Algeria.&nbsp; All the night long
the people keep passing on the road, and a small black mosquito,
resembling the Jejen of Paraguay, was most impertinent.</p>
<p>Next morning (October 20th) we were early upon the road, as is
most generally the case in travel when one goes supperless to bed
and rises to get on horseback with but a cup of weak green tea
for breakfast.&nbsp; The animals had eaten well as we had barley
with us, and, as on the day before, we started climbing
staircases of rock, crossing and re-crossing the Wad el
N&rsquo;fiss, passing deserted villages, and interchanging
greetings with the various parties of travellers upon the
road.&nbsp; A precipitous descent over red sandstone rocks and
through a thicket of tall oleanders, brought us to an open space,
where the bed of the N&rsquo;fiss spread out about a quarter of a
mile in width.&nbsp; To right and left, at the distance of a mile
or two, on either hand perched upon hills were fortalices, and
farther up the valley a castle which I was destined to become
better acquainted with before night.&nbsp; The mountains, about
ten miles away, formed a most perfect semi-circle, and Tisi
Nemiri, <a name="citation133"></a><a href="#footnote133"
class="citation">[133]</a> upon our right, appeared to rise sheer
from the river into the clouds.</p>
<p>Mohammed el Hosein, who, all the morning, after the fashion of
a hungry man, had been exceedingly ill-humoured, now produced
from the recesses of his saddle-bags four rather small
pomegranates, which all five of us proceeded to devour with great
alacrity.&nbsp; Whilst eating, he informed us that the
semi-circle in <a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>front was the last ridge between us and the Sus, and
that with luck we ought to camp well in the province of the Sus
by evening.</p>
<p>Again we fell discussing our plan of action on reaching
Tarudant.&nbsp; All now depended upon passing the guard at the
N&rsquo;Zala, <a name="citation134"></a><a href="#footnote134"
class="citation">[134]</a> where an official of the Sultan was
reported to be permanently sitting at the receipt of such custom
as might come his way.&nbsp; Mohammed el Hosein was confident
that, for a dollar, he could get us past without much risk, I
shamming ill and sitting a little apart under a tree, whilst he
bargained with the official, the danger being that the man
should, out of civility, put some question to me which I must
answer, and thus, by my poor Arabic, betray myself, for Mohammed
el Hosein was sure that no one on the road had for a moment
questioned my identity.</p>
<p>In fact, about an hour before we camped, whilst riding along
one of the shingly stretches over which the road went following
the bed of the N&rsquo;fiss, I had been put to a pretty strong
test, and had emerged triumphantly.&nbsp; About a quarter of a
mile in front of us we saw a band of twenty people sitting on a
grassy slope and watching apparently for our passing by.&nbsp; Of
course we thought it was a detachment of tribesmen who had
penetrated my disguise and were about to attack us, but, as to
turn back was quite impossible, and even consultation difficult,
by reason of a party of travellers who followed us, we had to
face the difficulty, after having deliberated briefly upon my
dropping my handkerchief to give Mohammed el Hosein the
opportunity to get off and ride beside me to consult.&nbsp; As we
came closer I saw <a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>the people had no arms and were chiefly young men of
from eighteen to twenty years of age.&nbsp; Swani passed on the
word it was a Tolba, that is, a band of wandering students, in
fact, an Estudiantina, and then I knew what line of conduct to
adopt.&nbsp; Just as we crossed the river they came all round my
horse, wading in the fierce current above knee deep, and,
catching my cloak, kissed it most fervently, invoking blessings
on the Sherif from Fez, and calling upon Siddi bel Abbas, the
patron saint of travellers, to guard me from all harm.&nbsp; I
knew of course that that meant money, and blessed them in my best
Arabic, whilst luckily for me the splashing of the horses and the
men crossing the stream made so much noise I might have spoken in
Chinook for all they knew.&nbsp; I signed to Swani who advanced
and gave them a peseta, and some of them kissed my knees, which I
permitted graciously as to the manner born, and, stooping down,
touched with my right hand the head of one who seemed the
cleanest, and rode on, looking as ineffable as a man desperately
anxious and engaged in crossing a shingly, violent-running river
can be supposed to look.&nbsp; Mohammed el Hosein and Swani, the
danger past, and the travellers behind us having halted, laughed
till they almost fell off their pack saddles; Lutaif, I think,
gave thanks after the fashion of the Lebanon, and Ali looked at
me, thinking, I verily believe, I really was as holy as I hope I
looked.</p>
<p>Naturally, this little passage raised our spirits, as the
students of the Tolba, though beggars, were all educated men, had
wandered much about the country, and must have seen Christians at
the coast towns a thousand times.&nbsp; I recommend to
educational reformers a peripatetic university after the Tolba
system.&nbsp; The students might beg their way along on bicycles,
listen to lectures in convenient places&mdash;upon commons, under
railway arches, beside canal locks, <a name="page136"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 136</span>and the like&mdash;play football, as
the members of the Tolba in Morocco play, by the roadsides, and
thus high thinking with low diet, football, and bicycle, might
all conduce to scholarship, to health, and knowledge of the
country roads.&nbsp; In Morocco the system works well enough,
although some say that in the Tolbas those customs flourish which
have led scholars in England to Malebolge.&nbsp; Even of
stationary universities ill-natured things have been
preferred.&nbsp; Be all that as it may, it seems a merry life to
lounge along, to read under the olive trees, camp near some
village, write charms for folk who want them, and recite whole
chapters from the Koran, at night, yelling them out in chorus,
after the way of children learning their lessons in a
kindergarten.</p>
<p>So, thinking on the Tolba, our spirits rose, and we determined
to send Ali to the nearest house to buy provisions.&nbsp; Lucky
we did so, for it provided us with a square meal which we were
destined not to enjoy again for several days.&nbsp; It appeared,
the N&rsquo;Zala once passed, that a sharp descent of some three
hours led into the plain beyond.&nbsp; There, according to
Mohammed el Hosein, the people were all armed and very warlike;
and the road to Tarudant led through the main streets of several
villages.&nbsp; He did not look forward to much risk in passing
them, but thought there might be a chance of falling in with
robbers by the way, who naturally would rob a Moor (they being
Berbers) quite cheerfully, and would without doubt kill any
Christian whom they came across, not being restrained by fear of
the authorities, as are the people in the settled parts of the
country across the mountain.&nbsp; However, Mohammed el Hosein
finished up always by saying, &ldquo;We are in Allah&rsquo;s
hand; but leave it all to me, for if danger should occur it is
not for nothing I am called the cleverest muleteer upon the
southern road.&rdquo;&nbsp; And as he spoke his little Shillah <a
name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 137</span>eyes
sparkled like live coals, his thin, black, pointed beard wagged
to and fro, and his face and muscular arms twitched and
contracted as he shook with laughter in the enjoyment of the
joke.&nbsp; To deceive anyone is always pleasing to a Moor
(sometimes to Christians also), and to take in a town and pass an
infidel upon it as a Sherif from Fez appeared to him the greatest
piece of humour of his life.&nbsp; To our enquiries as to what
was best to do if, in a village, I was recognised, his answer was
invariably the same, so that at last I did not bother him, seeing
him confident, and feeling almost certain in my mind the worst
was past.&nbsp; Ali returned laden with bread and mutton, eggs
and fruit, and we sat down to eat our last repast in freedom in
the jurisdiction of the Kaid of Kintafi, whom Ali told us lived
like a Sultan, and that he had had to wait full half an hour with
other travellers before being permitted to purchase food.</p>
<p>Lunch over, we got on the road in great good humour, and for
an hour crossed a bare stony plain, till, winding round a little
hill, we came suddenly into full view of a deserted house on one
side of the road, and about half-a-mile away upon the right an
immense castle surrounded by gardens, woods, and cultivated
grounds, and with the river El N&rsquo;fiss flowing just
underneath the walls.&nbsp; Mohammed el Hosein knew the place
well, and said it was called Talet el Jacub, the summer residence
of the Kaid el Kintafi, the governor of the province that we were
journeying through.&nbsp; &ldquo;Please God, he is not on the
look out for us,&rdquo; he said half laughing; and as he spoke a
messenger came running to meet us, his clothes tucked into his
belt, bare-headed, and a long staff in one hand.&nbsp; We took no
notice, and he overtook us and asked where we were going, and
Mohammed el Hosein replied, &ldquo;Towards God&rsquo;s
land,&rdquo; an Arabic retort to an inquisitive enquiry on the
road.&nbsp; The messenger <a name="page138"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 138</span>retorted, &ldquo;This is no laughing
matter, a man came to the Kaid&rsquo;s house this morning and
said he had heard there was a Christian on the road disguised as
a Mohammedan.&rdquo;&nbsp; Luckily all this passed in Shillah,
and the speaker scarcely knew as much Arabic as I myself.&nbsp; I
called up Swani and told him to tell Mohammed el Hosein that I
was going to see Basha Hamou, at Tarudant, and that I had not
time to call upon the Kaid, as I intended to camp that night in
Sus.&nbsp; The man looked at me, at Swani, and at Lutaif, who
spoke to him in Arabic, and he said, &ldquo;Then you are not
Christians?&rdquo; to which Swani replied, &ldquo;No, burn their
fathers;&rdquo; and the messenger, after profuse apologies,
returned towards the castle at a dog-trot.</p>
<p>Who now so certain as ourselves of our arrival at
Tarudant?&nbsp; We agreed the Kaid will stop all passers-by and
lose much time, and in five hours at most we shall be past his
jurisdiction, and it is not in the Sus that he will follow us,
even should he discover his mistake.</p>
<p>So we spurred on quite merrily, laughing and talking of the
rage the Kaid would fall into when he heard some day how near he
had had the Christians in his hand.&nbsp; Past walnut woods,
through thickset of scrub oak, by gardens into which the water
ran through trunks of hollow trees, upwards steeply ran the road,
passing by hedges thick with brambles and dog roses, giving a
look of Spain or Portugal, and every step we went we laughed at
the discomfiture of the foolish Kaid.</p>
<p>After an hour of steep ascent over the shoulder of a mountain
called Tisi in Test (Hill of the Oaks), we struck a steep
staircase of rocks, and Mohammed el Hosein said, &ldquo;In an
hour from here we shall pass a castle by the roadside, it is the
guard-house of the Kaid, and from thence to the N&rsquo;Zala is
but half an hour.&nbsp; Once there, in a few hours you will see
<a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>the tall
towers of the mosques in Tarudant.&rdquo;&nbsp; So we determined
(it was then about one o&rsquo;clock) to push on without eating
and sleep in Sus.&nbsp; The steep ascent proved steeper than any
we had passed, but we cared nothing for it, knowing we were so
near our goal.</p>
<p>At last we neared the castle by the roadside, no one seemed
stirring near it, and we were just about to pass the gate when a
loud shouting just below us made us turn our heads.&nbsp; To our
amazement we saw our friend the messenger accompanied by several
well-armed men, bounding up the steep road like an Oudad
(moufflon), and shouting, in Shillah, in a voice to wake the
dead.&nbsp; Men rushed out of the castle and ran for their
horses, and the messenger arrived just as we were about to pass
the door.&nbsp; We stopped, and putting on an air of quiet
citizens, alarmed upon the road, asked what the matter was,
although we knew.&nbsp; Men rushed and seized our animals, called
out &ldquo;Arrumin!&rdquo; that is, &ldquo;The Christians!&rdquo;
brandished their guns, fingered their daggers, and for a moment
things looked ugly.&nbsp; I sat upon my horse hardly quite
catching all that was said.&nbsp; Lutaif expostulated and Swani,
calling on Allah, asked the Sheikh, who now had come out of his
house, and stood waiting till some one brought him his horse, if
he looked like a Christian.&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the
Sheikh, &ldquo;you appear to be a cursed sailor from the coast,
accustomed to sail upon the black water, and to consort no doubt
with Christians.&rdquo;&nbsp; Swani looked as if he would have
liked some private conversation with the Sheikh near Tangier, but
prudently said nothing, and the Sheikh turned to Lutaif and asked
him who he was.&nbsp; Lutaif replied, &ldquo;A Syrian and a
Taleb, and the attendant of this gentleman,&rdquo; pointing to
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the Sheikh, &ldquo;this is the
Rumi,&rdquo; and, turning to me, said, &ldquo;Is it not so, or
will you swear <a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>you are a true believer?&rdquo;&nbsp; Swearing is easy
if you possess a language pretty well, but difficult in
&ldquo;petit n&egrave;gre,&rdquo; and so, knowing we should be
taken back before the Kaid and then found out, I answered
&ldquo;Yes, I am the Christian,&rdquo; and began to feel my
horse&rsquo;s mouth ready for what might come.</p>
<p>As Allah willed it nothing occurred beyond a little shouting,
and some rather tempestuous brandishing of guns, and threatening
looks.&nbsp; The Sheikh, who by this time had got upon his horse,
rode up to me and looked me in the face.&nbsp; I said,
&ldquo;Have you ever seen a European before?&rdquo; but his
Arabic was at an end, and the rest passed in Shillah between
Mohammed el Hosein and the man sent by the Governor.</p>
<p>It appeared the messenger had gone back to the castle and told
the Kaid we were not Christians, and that I seemed a reputable
man, riding a good black horse.&nbsp; On that the Kaid exclaimed,
&ldquo;Black horse, I was told the Christian bought a black horse
in Amsmiz, so after them at once with four or five armed
men;&rdquo; and to teach him circumspection and lightness of
foot, had him well beaten before he sent him off.&nbsp; A guard
of men advanced and took our bridles and began to lead us back,
as downcast a company as you might see upon a long day&rsquo;s
march.&nbsp; I felt like Perkin Warbeck going to the Tower, and
rode quite silent, but cursing under my breath, whilst, as I take
it, the loud jokes which passed in Shillah were most amusing to
our captors, though I feel doubtful, even had I understood them,
that they would have amused me in the least.&nbsp; One ragged
tribesman tried to snatch my gun, which I had borrowed from the
Consul in Mogador, but I kept hold of it and told him that if it
no longer belonged to me it was the Kaid&rsquo;s, and I should
tell him of the theft.&nbsp; Nothing takes better with the Arabs
and Berbers than an answer of this kind, and when he understood
it the man grinned <a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>like a baboon and said he was no thief.&nbsp; I had my
own opinion about this, but thought it wise not to disclose it,
and at that moment a heavy storm of rain swept down from off the
hills and wet us to the skin.&nbsp; We now began to press our
animals, and the escort bounded like goats beside us, one of them
trying to prick my horse with a long knife to make him
kick.&nbsp; The headman, seeing the joke, promptly struck him
across the head with a thick stick, the blow being enough to have
stunned a European, but which did not seem much to annoy him, and
he trotted along just like a hound who has received a cut from
the second whip for running a false scent.</p>
<p>In about three-quarters of an hour we did that which had taken
us two hours to come, our animals rushing down the steep paths in
the heavy storm, and the escort shouting and cursing like
demoniacs.&nbsp; We plunged into a wood, crossed a flooded
stream, rode through a field of standing corn, and, crossing the
maidan <a name="citation141"></a><a href="#footnote141"
class="citation">[141]</a> before the castle, came to a
horse-shoe arch.&nbsp; Assembled before the entrance was a crowd
of armed retainers, loafers, herdsmen, travellers, and all the
riff-raff who, in Morocco, haunt the dwellings of rich men.&nbsp;
Boys, and more boys, oxen, and goats, and horses, all pressed
into the gateway and the dark winding passage, to escape the
storm.&nbsp; Loud rose the cry of &ldquo;Christians, sons of
dogs.&rdquo;&nbsp; I thought, in the dark passage, that the
occasion seemed quite favourable for some believer to strike a
quiet blow for Allah&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>Swani pushed forward, and placed himself beside me on his
mule; so pushing, striving, cursing, and dripping with the rain,
we reached a second gateway, which opened into a court; and here
the travellers, <a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>herdsmen, and the rest entered, and left us, with our
escort, standing in semi-darkness below the arch.&nbsp; For a
full hour we waited&mdash;I, sitting on my horse, partly from
pride and partly from the instinctive feeling of a horseman that
he is always safer on his horse; the others dismounted, and sat
down on a stucco bench, looking the picture of misery and
discontent.&nbsp; We did not talk much&mdash;though I felt
inclined to laugh&mdash;the position striking me as comic enough
in all its aspects; and at last a fat man, in immaculate white
robes, holding a bunch of keys, came through the rain across the
inner court, and asked my name.&nbsp; I told it to him, and he
seemed edified, and asked what I was doing, and why I wished to
go to Tarudant.&nbsp; This was most difficult to explain, for in
Morocco few people journey out of curiosity, so I replied I had
business with the Governor.&nbsp; The man then turned towards
Lutaif, and said: &ldquo;You are a Mohammedan, why do you travel
with this Christian?&nbsp; You are a taleb, and should know
better than to connive at a Christian travelling in Moorish
dress.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lutaif had to explain he was a Christian, and
the fat man then turned upon Mohammed el Hosein, and said:
&ldquo;You are no Christian, and the Kaid says he will shave your
beard, give you the stick, and put you into prison with some
comfortable irons on your feet.&rdquo;&nbsp; To such a speech
there was no very obvious answer but &ldquo;Allah Kerim,&rdquo;
which poor Mohammed el Hosein mumbled piteously enough; and the
fat man, kilting his snow-white robes, waddled across the court,
and went into the house, without another word.</p>
<p>And so we waited, as it seemed hours, till again across the
court came the fat, snow-white-robed official, accompanied by a
short, broad-shouldered man with a full black beard, who, walking
up to me, held out a hand, and said, &ldquo;Bon
jour.&rdquo;&nbsp; I answered, <a name="page143"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 143</span>but his French extended no further,
and he tried Turkish&mdash;of which I did not know a word.&nbsp;
Lutaif, who spoke it well, entered into a conversation with him,
when it appeared he was a Persian&mdash;a sort of wandering
minstrel&mdash;who was staying with the Kaid and had been sent,
upon the strength of his &ldquo;Bon jour,&rdquo; to find out who
we were.&nbsp; As I was still uncertain if the Globe Venture
Syndicate&rsquo;s steamer was off the coast, we took good care to
make it plain we were friends of Basha Hamou, for, had the vessel
arrived, we should have been thrown into prison at once, and sent
in chains up to the Sultan&rsquo;s camp.&nbsp; However, no
suspicion of this seemed to cross the people&rsquo;s minds, and
we sat on talking to the old Persian in a jargon of mixed Arabic
and Turkish for some time, whilst gradually a crowd of people had
assembled, who&mdash;sitting on the ground, on stones, and on a
low divan which ran right round the arches&mdash;glared at us
silently, like men looking at wild beasts.&nbsp; A boy or two
threw a few stones, but they were stopped immediately&mdash;the
order having evidently gone out to treat us well.&nbsp;
Considering all things, and how completely we were in their
power, how far removed from any Europeans, and how strong the
spirit of dislike is to all strangers, especially amongst the
Berber tribes, the conduct of the people was quite wonderful; and
I question very much if in a European country we should, in
similar conditions, have fared as well.&nbsp; Still, the
uncertainty made waiting anxious work, and we were pleased to
hear from the old Persian that the Kaid was in a dilemma as to
what he should do with us&mdash;whether to send us back, let us
go on, or write for instructions to the Sultan as to what course
to take.&nbsp; At last the Chamberlain, wrapped this time in one
of the Atlas brown goat-hair cloaks&mdash;called by the Berber an
Achnif&mdash;came back again, and said the Kaid had made his mind
up to extend <a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>his hospitality to us, and that he had placed a tent at
our disposal on the Maidan.&nbsp; The phrase admitted no
discussion; and so following the Chamberlain&mdash;and preceded
by an attendant with a long gun&mdash;we rode to the Maidan, and
found a tent pitched on the wet ground above the bank of the
N&rsquo;fiss, into which all of us, with saddles and baggage,
were glad to pack, to get out of the rain.&nbsp; The tent was
large, and circular in shape, ornamented outside with rows of
blue cloth decanters&mdash;after the Moorish fashion&mdash;and
lined with a chintz of the most pre-Morris kind.&nbsp; In
addition to its beauties of form and decoration it leaked in
several places, and was so loosely pitched that we had to turn to
at once to make it safe, and dig a trench to carry off the water,
which stood about an inch in depth upon the floor.&nbsp; Five men
with packsaddles, bridles, and guns, and all the requisites for
camping, left very little room to move about.&nbsp; A forlorn
crew we must have looked as we sat, shivering and hungry, on the
damp floor.&nbsp; Closing the door, I drew from my saddle-bags a
bottle of brandy which I had in reserve for snake-bites, and
administering a dose (medicinally) to believers and infidels
alike, a better spirit soon prevailed, and we got beds made
down&mdash;placing some stones to keep the blankets off the
ground.&nbsp; A fire was lighted; and as we drank our
tea&mdash;flavoured with some mint which Ali drew out of his bag,
where it had lain for days amongst tobacco, pieces of string, and
the &ldquo;menavellings&rdquo; of a muleteer&rsquo;s
profession&mdash;we set about reviewing our position, after a
joke or two, as to the enjoyment of the hospitality so generously
provided by the Kaid.&nbsp; For myself, I was not in much
trepidation, knowing the worst that could occur was to be sent
under a guard to the Sultan&rsquo;s camp&mdash;a matter of from
five to six days&rsquo; journey.&nbsp; As to Mohammed el Hosein,
that was more serious.&nbsp; Already he had been <a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>threatened
with the stick, imprisonment, and with the loss of
beard&mdash;the greatest insult which can be put on a
Mohammedan.&nbsp; But the poor devil (and we ourselves) knew well
that in his case the stick most probably meant death, and that he
would not live to undergo the other punishment.&nbsp; Still, he
was not so much downcast as might have been expected, but sat in
the wet mud&mdash;a bellows in his hand&mdash;blowing the
charcoal for the tea; and said, resignedly, &ldquo;We are in
Allah&rsquo;s hand; but it is a pity I was but newly married
before leaving Mogador.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Swani, as a man, so to speak, without caste, was safe, and the
most he could expect was a few dozen blows with a stout stick, a
matter about which he did not seem to care a halfpenny, for he
knew that he could plead he came under compulsion as my servant,
and the plea would almost certainly be held sufficient at least
to save his life.</p>
<p>Ali, of course, could not be held an accessory before the
fact, as he left Mogador without the least idea of our intention,
and I assured him if he lost his mule that I would buy him one
fit for the Sultan&rsquo;s saddle.</p>
<p>As we sat talking, we perceived that a group of tribesmen, all
fully armed, had sat down just outside the tent, the rain having
ceased for a little, and were regarding us quite motionless, but
with their eyes not losing any action that we made.&nbsp; Of
course, we were the strangest spectacle they had ever seen, and
after half an hour, their curiosity well satisfied, they moved
off silently and sat down in the same manner to watch a game of
football, which was proceeding on the Maidan, and in which all
the young men, from slaves to the Kaid&rsquo;s sons, were taking
part.&nbsp; So we resumed deliberations, and discussed the
position of Lutaif.&nbsp; He was perhaps, of all of us, in the
most dangerous case.&nbsp; A Syrian and a Turkish subject,
without a paper of protection from any European Consul, as <a
name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 146</span>he said
himself: &ldquo;If the Kaid wants to kill me, he will do so as if
I were a dog, and you may be certain that my Sultan will not
claim compensation for the death of any Christian.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
thought about Armenia, but the time was scarcely opportune for
joking; and just as all our spirits and our stomachs were at the
lowest ebb, a slave came from the Kaid, bringing a dish of
couscousou, <a name="citation146"></a><a href="#footnote146"
class="citation">[146]</a> which we devoured at once, and could
have eaten at least five times as much.&nbsp; The canvas door was
lifted, and, with a cheerful but irrelevant <i>Bon jour</i> the
Persian entered, sat down without a word and, after looking at me
for a moment or two, said &ldquo;Mezquin&rdquo; (that is,
&ldquo;poor fellow&rdquo;), &ldquo;how far you are from
home.&rdquo;&nbsp; This, though a truism, had not occurred to me,
but put thus, <i>&agrave; br&ucirc;le pourpoint</i>, it seemed to
come home with great force to Lutaif, to Swani, and to Mohammed
el Hosein, and for a moment they seemed about to weep, after the
fashion of the two aged men who wept because they both were
orphans.</p>
<p>The Persian promised &ldquo;to stand before the Kaid and speak
for us,&rdquo; and to return to-morrow and relate his life to
us.&nbsp; We all bid him good night with great effusion, as he
had been a valued friend, and watched him walk across the Maidan
into the castle, and perceived that round our tent, some fifty
yards away, on every side, squatted a sentinel.</p>
<p>Whilst we sat trying to dry our clothes, from the castle
mosque broke out the call to prayers, called by the Persian in a
voice like the last trumpet&rsquo;s sound, the tower seemed to
rock, and the hills gave back God&rsquo;s <a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>name from
every crag and hollow, till the whole valley quivered with the
sound, and the night air was all pervaded by the echoing
cry.&nbsp; If God is God surely Mohammed knew his nature when he
appointed men to call by night, bidding the faithful rise to
pray, and speaking as it were with Allah face to face, as
standing on some tower in the night, they tell his
attributes.</p>
<h2><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Next</span> morning rain was still coming
down in torrents and we awoke to find our tent, in spite of all
precautions, swimming in water.&nbsp; Nothing to do, even without
the &ldquo;hospitality&rdquo; of the Kaid, but to cower over a
charcoal brazier, and to send Swani to try and buy provisions for
our breakfast.&nbsp; After a little he returned bringing the
chamberlain, who informed us rather tartly that the Kaid Si Taieb
ben Si Ahmed El Hassan El Kintafi <a name="citation148"></a><a
href="#footnote148" class="citation">[148]</a> sold no
provisions, but that we and our animals would be cared for at his
expense.&nbsp; In about half an hour two negro slaves appeared,
bringing couscousou and meat cut up and stewed with pumpkins, and
so we fell to with an appetite improved by the past days spent on
short commons.&nbsp; People arrived in bands and squatted down
before the tent, and when one band had seen enough, another took
its place and sat on doggedly for half an hour with the rain
dripping down their backs.&nbsp; Till about midday, when the rain
began to slacken, no one addressed us, though a man, shod with
sandals of oxhide with the hair on, after the style of those used
in the outer Hebrides till a few years ago, and once worn by all
Scotchmen, as the name &ldquo;rough-footed Scot&rdquo; implies,
looked at us, opened his mouth, but then thought better of it and
passed away.&nbsp; Had he but spoken, it would have been in
Shillah, but still I wish I knew what that poor tribesman was
about to say.</p>
<p><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>After
the midday prayer, a jet-black negro walked into the tent,
dressed all in white with a large silver earring hanging from one
ear and with three stripes tattooed or scarified upon his
cheek.&nbsp; He sat down in a friendly manner on my cloak, which
I drew to me and he then sat quite as contentedly on the wet
mud.&nbsp; He spoke good Arabic, and to my observation that it
was cold, replied &ldquo;Yes, but not half so cold as
London.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thinking it was a joke, I said, &ldquo;That
is extremely likely, but have you been there?&rdquo; and I then
learned he had been there twice, in the suite of a Sheikh from
the Sahara who had been in London about some business of the Cape
Juby Company.&nbsp; The Cape Juby Company was one of those
strange ventures which when they fail, men say that their
promoters were all mad, but if they prosper make their projectors
founders of empires, and people think their brains effected that
which was really chance.&nbsp; There is no really sane head
either on horseback <a name="citation149a"></a><a
href="#footnote149a" class="citation">[149a]</a> or the Stock
Exchange.</p>
<p>Almost in sight of Fuerteventura, the nearest in shore of the
Canaries, between Wad Nun and the Cabo de Bojador, not quite
within the tropics, Cape Juby lies.&nbsp; From the Wad Nun,
almost to St. Louis Senegal, nothing but sand, a lowish coast, no
settled population, and but little water; and yet a Scotchman,
one Mr. Mackenzie, who in the seventies had an idea to flood the
Sahara and trade direct from London to Timbuctoo, induced some
lords and gentlemen to found a company and put their factory on
an island off the Cape. <a name="citation149b"></a><a
href="#footnote149b" class="citation">[149b]</a></p>
<p>The island is a lone rock, disjoined from land by a <a
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>little
channel at high tide.&nbsp; Upon it, without much ceremony, the
company erected buildings, built a wall, mounted the inevitable
cannon to keep the peace, and tried to start a trade.&nbsp; Just
opposite the island grow a few tamarisk bushes, in Arabic called
Torfaia, and near these bushes is a brackish well.&nbsp; The
tamarisks give the name, and the spot is called Torfaia up and
down the coast, being remarkable as the only place where any
vegetation lives.&nbsp; The population is nomad and composed of
wandering Arab tribes, who in remote times came from the Yemen
and still speak the dialect of the Koreish in all its
purity.&nbsp; When the wind blows, the sand moves like a sea, so
that the company found their walls, built for defence, were in
about three months all sanded up, and an Arab on his camel could
fire right down into the fort.</p>
<p>Upon this likely spot Mr. Mackenzie and his company pitched to
establish trade with the interior of the Sahara, pending the time
their ships could sail direct to Timbuctoo.&nbsp; If I remember
rightly, the Empire (British) was to be increased, the wandering
Arabs all to acknowledge Queen Victoria&rsquo;s reign, and peace
and plenty, with a fair modicum of profit, be the order of the
day.</p>
<p>Below Wad Nun the Arab tribes live practically as they lived
in Arabia before Mohammed.&nbsp; Morocco is too far away to be
much feared, the negro tribes to the south and east not strong
enough to fight, the Touaregs not disposed to attack men like the
Arabs who can only give hard knocks; whilst in the Senegal the
French, in spite of that consuming hunger for sand, as witness
Southern Algeria, Tunis, and the desire they are said to have to
make a sandy empire from Tripoli to Senegal, are not so foolish
as to adventure, merely for glory, to attack the desert
tribes.&nbsp; Thus any Sheikh, or Sherif, who has a little power
<a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>becomes
a king, after the style of Chedorlaomer in the Bible, and rules
over other kings who do him homage, if he has power enough at his
command.&nbsp; Some kinglet of this kind was duly found, and a
treaty made with him.&nbsp; In fact, the man appeared in London,
passed by the title of King of the Sahara, stayed at a good
hotel, and no doubt did members of the company good service by
his stay.&nbsp; But as mischance would have it, treason broke out
at home whilst the Saharan King was sojourning amongst the
infidel.&nbsp; On his return &ldquo;patriots,&rdquo; that is, I
fancy, other Sheiks the company had overlooked and not
&ldquo;made right,&rdquo; refused to ratify the treaty, and the
poor King was treated as a traitor who had sold his fellows to
the Christian dogs.</p>
<p>Years passed away (sixteen I think), and managers went out who
drew their salaries; clerks not a few contracted fever, and some
died; Arabs attacked the place with varying success; the people
of the fort went out to hunt in peace time, and in war sat
drinking gin; but still no business was effected, and the whole
place began to look like a small Goa, Pondicherry, or some
Spanish island in the Eastern seas, where every other man has a
fine gold-laced uniform, but has no food to eat.&nbsp; Then some
one had a luminous idea, which was to sell the place to the
Sultan of Morocco, who, wishing to extend his empire, bought it,
and has to-day the pleasure of keeping a steamer running from the
Canaries, week in week out, to keep the garrison supplied with
water, for the well beneath the tamarisks has given out.</p>
<p>My negro visitor was from Wad Nun, had been to London twice
and did not like it, in fact, remembered nothing but the cold and
the striking fact that the horses had short tails.&nbsp; Yet he
was intelligent after his fashion, and greatly exercised as to
the reason which impelled those Argonauts to sail to such a
Colchis, and <a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>glad to tell how they bought nothing but a little wool,
and wondered if they knew of gold mines, or what kept them stuck
for sixteen years in such a place.&nbsp; The manager, Mackenzie,
was a Scotchman, which he interpreted to be a title of
respectability, and informed us that Mackenzie&rsquo;s name was
known far in the Sahara, and that at times natives would ride up,
who had never seen him, and greet him as Sidi Mackenzie, for they
all had heard of his red beard, his title (Scotchman), and of the
strong spirit kept in a barrel which none but he might
drink.&nbsp; My negro tapped his head and told me it was full of
news, but that, unluckily, his purse was empty, or he would long
ago have left the place.&nbsp; I did not take the hint, and he
retired wishing me patience, with a negro grin.</p>
<p>Patience was what I most had need of, except, perhaps,
tobacco, at the time.&nbsp; So strolling out on to the Maidan,
the rain having ceased at last, I sat down on a large stone under
an olive tree to think about the situation and enjoy the
view.&nbsp; In a magnificent amphitheatre of hills with snowy
mountains towering overhead, just at the angle which the Wad el
N&rsquo;fiss makes after the first five miles of its course,
about the middle of a valley almost ten miles in length, the Azib
<a name="citation152"></a><a href="#footnote152"
class="citation">[152]</a> of El Kintafi lies; around it fifteen
or twenty acres of Indian corn, a grove of olive trees and
pomegranate gardens, wild and uncared for as gardens always are
throughout the East.&nbsp; The house itself with its mosque, the
various court-yards, towers, kiosques, stables, fortified
passages, and a long stretch of crenelated wall, covers almost as
much ground as Kenilworth or Arundel.&nbsp; Built all of mud, and
here and there painted light yellow, it yet looks solid, and in
one angle rises the tower of the mosque covered with tiles like
those of the Alhambra.</p>
<p><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>The
castle wall upon one side runs almost sheer down into the river
which tosses on a stony bed, leaving a sort of sandy beach, on
which grow oleanders, and across the stream the shoulder of Tisi
Nemiri <a name="citation153"></a><a href="#footnote153"
class="citation">[153]</a> almost reaches to the bank.&nbsp;
Above the oleanders ran a mill stream in which the tiniest barble
played or hung suspended in the slack water, aping the attitude
of salmon lying suspended in the shallow water of a linn.&nbsp;
Between the mill stream and the beach grew some Indian corn
fenced in with Suddra bushes, looking steely-grey in the bright
sun, or as if frosted, when the moon turned every twig and thorn
to silver in its cold light.&nbsp; Curious little round hills
studded the valley in various directions, and on the west side
rose Ouichidan to an apparent height of about fourteen thousand
feet, or, say, six thousand feet above the bed of the
N&rsquo;fiss.&nbsp; Almost at the top of Ouichidan there is a
spring held sacred by the Berbers, who have retained many Pagan
customs and superstitions, although Mohammedans.&nbsp; It is said
that from the top a view of both Morocco city and Tarudant is
seen, but Allahu Alem, God he knows, for never has the foot of
unbeliever trod the snow, nor has the pestilent surveyor, with
his boiling tubes, his aneroid, theodolite, and all his trumpery,
defiled the peak.</p>
<p>What is known, is that a pass leads into the Sus over a
shoulder of the mountain, and a poor Jewish merchant whom I
subsequently met, informed me that whilst crossing it he had
prayed more fervently than he had done since quite a child, and
said devoutly, &ldquo;May Jehovah keep me from all such cursed
roads.&rdquo;&nbsp; Amongst the maize fields, which at my time of
sojourning as guest of El Kintafi were all ripe, negroes and
negresses were husking the heads of maize which <a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>had been
reaped, and were all gathered up in heaps.&nbsp; Their flat and
merry faces, red and yellow clothes, loud cries, and air of
working as for amusement, brought back the Southern States, and
as half the men answered to Quasi, and the women all appeared to
be called Sultana, the illusion was complete.&nbsp; Most of the
negroes had become Mohammedans, and, of course, the women had to
follow suit; few of them spoke Arabic or even Shillah, and a sort
of ganger, who spoke Soudanese, lay in the shade and made a show
of overseeing their pretence of work.&nbsp; Upon the flat roof of
the palace prisoners heavily chained tottered about and husked
the Indian corn, each man resolved to do as little work as
possible, and spend the greatest possible amount of time in
walking to and fro.&nbsp; Poor devils, mostly tribesmen from a
rebellious tribe which lived upon the head waters of the
N&rsquo;fiss, and which neither the Kaid, his father, or his
grandfather, had ever been quite able to subdue.&nbsp; The
rebellious tribe is a feature of the Eastern world.&nbsp; No
Sultanate so small, no little caliphate lost in the hills, no
territory of mountains or of plains that is without its
rebels.&nbsp; Throughout Morocco one comes now and again upon a
tribe in open warfare, if not with the Sultan at least against
its Governor.&nbsp; They raise an army, fight in the hills, take
prisoners and cut their throats, behave, in fact, as Arabs have
behaved since they first came into our Western life, and at the
last the Sultan or the Governor prevails, and a few dozen heads
of the chief tribesmen adorn the city walls, making long smears
of blood down the pale yellow wash, and shrivelling by degrees
into a hideous mass, like an old fly-blown shoe.&nbsp; Yet on the
roof of the Kaid&rsquo;s Kasbah <a name="citation154"></a><a
href="#footnote154" class="citation">[154]</a> the prisoners gave
a scriptural note, and made one think <a name="page155"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 155</span>on Jeremiah, <a
name="citation155"></a><a href="#footnote155"
class="citation">[155]</a> the prisoner-prophet, who must have
wandered up and down as they did, before Pashur smote him and set
him in the stocks, putting him daily to derision and making
everyone to mock at him.&nbsp; Not that the Berbers mocked at the
prisoners on the castle roof, but, on the contrary, sat with the
blazing sun upon their shaven pates, talking to them from the
Maidan, gave them bits of bread, and so behaved themselves that,
chains and famine, lice and sores discounted, the condition of
the prisoners was nearer to that of men at large than that of the
betracted, ticketed transgressors in a London gaol.&nbsp; At
times upon the roof the prisoners lay full length and held their
chains up in one hand to test their legs, and, lying close to the
parapet, chaffed the negroes as they came and went carrying as
little maize as possible in small baskets holding about a
peck.&nbsp; At night the Kaid, who had a not unnatural wish to
keep his prisoners safe, lowered them one by one into a deep, dry
well, a mule revolving slowly round a rude kind of capstan, as
with an esparto rope hitched in a bowline below their arm-pits,
one by one they were lowered underneath the ground.&nbsp; When
all were down, four negroes placed a large flat stone over the
well, and the Muezzin called on the faithful all to praise
God&rsquo;s name.&nbsp; What the state of the well was down below
is hard to say, but in the morning when the stone was rolled
aside a stench as from a Tophet rose, and early on the fourth day
of our enforced &ldquo;villegiatura,&rdquo; a starveling donkey
was driven past our tent with the body of a prisoner (escaped
from prison and from life) thrown over it, the head and feet
dangling upon the ground, and the donkey-driver pricking his
beast with a piece of sharpened cane in <a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>an old,
thoroughly-established sore over which the flies buzzed, settled,
flew off again and then alighted on the eyelids of the
corpse.</p>
<p>And so the second day went past in rather greater comfort than
the first, the rain having ceased, and we became aware that it
was best to resign ourselves to what the Kaid and Providence
might have in store for us.&nbsp; About the evening prayer I
despatched Lutaif to try and get an audience and find out why we
were detained, but, after waiting more than an hour at the castle
gate, he returned to say that the great man was invisible, but
that his Chamberlain would come and see us after
supper-time.&nbsp; The Chamberlain not having come by sundown,
and our animals not having eaten for four-and-twenty hours, I
sent Swani to &ldquo;stand and cry at the gate,&rdquo; after the
Eastern fashion, with the result that soon the slave who had the
key of the corn arrived and struck a bargain with me, I
undertaking to tip him handsomely on my departure if he fed our
beasts.&nbsp; This he declared he would do, but kept them
half-starved, and totally refused to sell, either chopped straw
or hay, most probably having got orders from the Kaid to feed our
animals well, and having sold half the corn, which he no doubt
took everyday out of the granary, to passing travellers.&nbsp;
However, unjust stewards are not uncommon even in England, and he
kept his key so bright (it measured nearly eighteen inches long),
and dressed so charmingly in palest Eau de Nil, with a black
cloak bound round with pink, and lied so easily, and with such
circumstance, that I forbore to lay his case before the Kaid,
reserving to myself the power of not rewarding his hypothetic
services at my departure if he went too far in his small
villainies.&nbsp; Night brought the Chamberlain heading a small
procession of negroes carrying our supper, composed of various
dishes of meat and couscousou, piled up on <a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>earthenware
dishes placed in a wooden case, shaped like an old-time stable
sieve and covered with a conical-shaped top of straw through
which were run strips of red and black leather in a curious
pattern forming a kind of check.&nbsp; A dish of Moorish bread
fresh from the oven and made of brownish flour, well-garnished
with particles of the rough stones of the bread mill in which the
corn was ground, made up the banquet.&nbsp; We squatted on the
floor, Swani went round and poured water from a tin dish upon our
hands, and, after a pious Bismillah, we all dipped bits of bread
in the red grease and oil of the highly seasoned dishes and began
to eat, ladling the food into our mouths most painfully with the
right hand, and lifting the huge dishes to our mouths to drink
the soup.&nbsp; A loud <i>Bon jour</i> warned us the Persian was
outside the tent, waiting to tell us his adventures and to impart
the gossip of the place.&nbsp; Entering, he sat down with a
sonorous &ldquo;Peace be on you all,&rdquo; and, after one or two
cups of tea and a few cigarettes, began to talk.&nbsp; The Kaid,
he said, was puzzled about us, had thought at first of sending us
in chains to the Sultan&rsquo;s camp, again had thought of
letting us proceed, and yet again of sending us under a guard of
his own men to the Consul at Mogador, but at the last had not
imparted his design to our informant.&nbsp; He thought that
probably a messenger had been despatched to the Sultan in his
camp, and if that was the case we had better make our minds up to
at least a fortnight in the place, and afterwards, if the Sultan
should send for us, a fortnight at the camp, for things in
palaces go slowly; <a name="citation157"></a><a
href="#footnote157" class="citation">[157]</a> but, said the
Persian piously, &ldquo;may God not open the door of the Sultan
to you, or to any other man.&rdquo;&nbsp; By this I took it that
should the Sultan send for us we should pass an unpleasant
quarter of an hour, <a name="page158"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 158</span>though as there were several
Europeans in the camp, notably Kaid M&rsquo;Lean, the
instructor-general to the army, and a French doctor called
Linares, we might be able to get things arranged upon the
peace-with-honour plan.&nbsp; This matter duly gone into with
proper Oriental deliberation, the Persian entered on his
tale.&nbsp; Born sometimes in Shiraz, at others in Tabriz
(according to his fancy), it appeared that at an early age he had
left his country as an Ashik, <a name="citation158"></a><a
href="#footnote158" class="citation">[158]</a> that is, a
wandering singer, and gone to Turkey.&nbsp; There he had acquired
the Turkish language as he averred, but subsequent intercourse
with Arabs had mixed the tongues; in the same fashion a Spaniard,
Italian, or Portuguese gets mixed, on learning either of the
kindred languages.&nbsp; Such as it was, his jargon suited me,
and I spoke Arabic more fluently to him than I ever spoke that
tongue before, or think to speak it until I meet another Ashik
similarly graced.&nbsp; We spoke without a verb, without a
particle, like idiots or children, largely in adverbs and in
adjectives, and without shame on either side, each thinking that
the other was but little versed in Arabic, and that he
condescended to adopt a jargon to help his weaker friend.&nbsp;
The Persian&rsquo;s faithful fiddle was out of order, owing, he
said, to his falling off a donkey whilst on the &ldquo;roads of
hell&rdquo; which led up to Kintafi, but though without it, he
sang for hours, songs which he said treated of love in Persian,
and which I took on trust as not containing anything subversive
of morality, or fit to raise a blush upon the cheek of those used
to our Western ways.&nbsp; Hafiz he said he knew by heart, and
much of Jami, and those Rubaiyat which every weekly newspaper has
its columns full of he <a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>knew, but found them too
materialistic for his taste.</p>
<p>In outward visible appearance he was a perfect Kurd, squat and
broad-shouldered, his beard so thick that had you dropped a pin
in it it would not have touched the skin, eyes black and
piercing, face like a walnut, and a long love-lock hanging from
his shaven head down on his shoulder; in one ear he wore a silver
earring, and he was gifted with a voice perhaps the strongest
that I ever heard in man.&nbsp; Both a musician and a
philosopher, but yet a moralist, and a fanatic preacher of the
graces of Mohammed, but still a sceptic at the heart, and above
all a traveller, &ldquo;for by travelling a man, although his
purse grows light, still lays up treasures on which to live when
he is old.&nbsp; What is a Sultan, Kaid, Pasha, or Governor,
compared to him who is the Sultan of the world, when where night
catches him he rests and looks upon the stars?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, starting from Shiraz (occasionally Tabriz), he had run
over almost all Europe, Turkey, and a portion of the Northern
States of Africa.&nbsp; Had been in Serbistan, Atenas, and in
Draboulis (Tripoli), Massr-el-Kahira (Cairo), Stamboul, and Buda
Pesth, and of all lands in Europe thought most of Magyarstan;
&ldquo;for there the women have eyes like almonds, though they
drink too much beer, the men are tall and fierce, handsome
(husnar besaf), the horses large and elegant, they run as lightly
as gazelles on stony ground; and had the people but the blessing
of the true faith, he never would have left their
land.&rdquo;&nbsp; Their city, Buda Pesth, was larger than
Stamboul, more fine than Paris, Vienna, or than Shiraz, and in
the middle ran a river on which went steamboats, in which he used
to travel and pay his passage with a tune, for the Magyars, he
said, loved music better than they loved their God.&nbsp; In this
famed city he had known one Bamborah, who by interior evidence
and after <a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>cogitation I found to be Professor Vambery.&nbsp;
Large-hearted was this Bamborah, and speaking Persian, a
Christian dervish, knowing all the East, having read all books,
explored all countries, mastered all sciences and learning; the
friend of kings, for had not the Sultan Abdul Hamid (whom may God
preserve) sent him a ring of &ldquo;diamont&rdquo; worth a
thousand pounds, and Bamborah had shown it whilst they sat
discoursing in his hospitable house.</p>
<p>In fact of all the men, Christian or Moslem, he had ever met,
this Bamborah appeared to him the fittest to stand before a
king.&nbsp; But for himself even in Buda Pesth, the travelling
fever had impelled him to embark aboard a &ldquo;chimin de
fer,&rdquo; and go to Vienna, travelling all through the night
and reaching Vienna about the feyzir (day break), and straying up
and down the streets until at last he met a Turk who sold red
slippers, and lodged with him; but after several days spent in
the place, which gave him neither pleasure nor material gain,
went on to Baris to find upon the journey that the customs of the
East and West did not agree.&nbsp; The Christians know no
God.&nbsp; With them it is all money (Kulshi flus), with them no
stranger, no wayfaring man, for in that train to Baris he asked a
woman for some water to wash his hands so as to address Allah
after the fashion laid down in the holy books; she brought it,
and after washing, and his prayers all duly said, the passengers,
as he informed me, crowding about in an unseemly way to see him
pray, he smiled and thanked the woman, and taking out a cigarette
tendered it to her with his thanks.&nbsp; But she, born of a dog,
knowing no God and dead to shame&mdash;for is it not set down
&ldquo;to strangers and to wayfarers be
kind&rdquo;?&mdash;laughed an ill laugh and asked for
half-a-franc: franc, franc, and always franc, that is the
Christian&rsquo;s God.</p>
<p>Thus talking of the Alps and Alpujarras the time <a
name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 161</span>wore on,
and after saying again most earnestly &ldquo;May God not open the
door of our Lord the Sultan to you,&rdquo; he took his leave, and
as he went it seemed our only friend had gone.</p>
<p>Next morning found the situation still unchanged, and we began
to look about us and found out that we had several companions in
adversity.&nbsp; Camped in a tent about a hundred yards away were
three Kaids (<i>Biblic&eacute;</i> kings), from the province of
the Sus, who had been waiting more than a month for an audience
of our captor, he having summoned them to wait upon him to
confer, as the gipsies say, about &ldquo;the affairs of
Egypt.&rdquo;&nbsp; One of the &ldquo;kings&rdquo; turned out to
be a &ldquo;saint&rdquo; of some repute, a tall fine man of Arab
type and race, dressed all in spotless white, and reading always
in a little copy of some holy book under an olive tree, showing
no trace of trouble at his long wait, although he must have
passed through much annoyance and incurred considerable expense,
as almost all his animals had died through lack of food and the
change of climate from the warm lands of Sus to the cold winds of
the interior Atlas range.</p>
<p>Under the olive tree I sat and talked to him, chiefly through
the medium of Lutaif, and asked him much of Tarudant, from whence
his house was situated but a long day&rsquo;s ride.&nbsp; It
appeared that in the main the account of Gerhard Rohlfs, <a
name="citation161a"></a><a href="#footnote161a"
class="citation">[161a]</a> the Hamburg Jew, who visited it some
thirty years ago, is applicable to the city of to-day.&nbsp; The
Sherif spoke of the high walls mentioned by Rohlfs and Oskar
Lenz; <a name="citation161b"></a><a href="#footnote161b"
class="citation">[161b]</a> of the five gates called
Bab-el-Kasbah, Bab-el-Jamis, Bab-Ouled ben Noumas, Bab Targount,
and Bab Egorgan; of the high Kasbah, occupying, as Rohlfs says, a
space of 50,000 square metres, and cut off from the town by a
high crenelated wall.&nbsp; He dwelt upon <a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>the
cheapness of provisions, said that six eggs were bought for a
little copper coin called a &ldquo;musonah&rdquo; (known to the
Spaniards as &ldquo;blanquillo&rdquo;) and worth perhaps a
farthing.&nbsp; He said a pound of meat cost two or three
&ldquo;musonahs,&rdquo; spoke of the trade in brass and copper
vessels, and gave us to understand, of all the towns within the
empire of his Shereifian Majesty, that Tarudant was cheapest and
pleasantest to live in, and inferred it was because the people
had no dealings with the infidel.&nbsp; For, said he, &ldquo;the
infidel are Oulad el Haram&rdquo; (sons of the illegitimate),
ever a-stirring, never contented with their lot, afraid to be
alone, seeing no beauty in the sun, not caring for the sound of
running water, and even looking at a fine horse but for his
worth; men bound to a wife, the slave of all the things they
make; then, recollecting that I too was one of the dog descended,
he gravely drew his hand across his beard, and said, &ldquo;but
no doubt Allah made them cunning and wise for some great purpose
of his own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No doubt, in every town throughout the East, the presence of
even a small quantity of Europeans forces prices up, upsets the
national life, unsettles men, and after having done so, gives
them no equivalent for the mischief that it makes.</p>
<p>The mosques were three in number, one in the Kasbah, two in
the town, of which the principal was El Djama-el-Kebir, and the
most sacred Sidi-o-Sidi, the Saint of Saints, by which name
people of a serious turn of mind call the whole town in
conversation, as who should say, speaking of London, the city of
St. Paul.</p>
<p>I questioned him about the sugar-cane plantations, of which
both Luis de Marmol <a name="citation162"></a><a
href="#footnote162" class="citation">[162]</a> and Diego de <a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>Torres <a
name="citation163a"></a><a href="#footnote163a"
class="citation">[163a]</a> speak in their curious books written
in the middle of the sixteenth century, but he had never heard of
sugar-cane near Tarudant.&nbsp; This forms another proof of the
decadence into which all the land has fallen, for the climate and
soil of Tarudant should be at least as favourable for sugar-cane
as is the strip of territory in Spain which runs along the coast
from Malaga into the province of Almeria, where the Moors first
introduced the canes which grow there still to-day.</p>
<p>It appeared according to the Sherif that the town contained
some 1,400 houses, and a population which he estimated at 10,000,
<a name="citation163b"></a><a href="#footnote163b"
class="citation">[163b]</a> mostly in easy circumstances, but
very ill-disposed towards all foreigners.&nbsp; Much information
he imparted as to the mineral riches of the province; but without
descending to particulars, with the exception of sulphur, which
he said was found close to the town.&nbsp; Romans, of course, had
left their castles near the place, in the same way the Moors have
done in parts of Spain to which they never penetrated; but who
those Romans were remains for some more well-graced, or
fortunately starred traveller than I to tell of, commentate upon,
and weave a theory to content his public and himself.&nbsp;
Caravans, it seems, go straight to Timbuctoo taking European
goods, and bring back slaves and gold-dust, with ostrich feathers
and the other desert commodities, as in the time of Mungo
Park.&nbsp; At least they did; but I suppose the French in their
consuming zeal for <a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>freedom may have stopped slaves from being bought in
these degenerate days.&nbsp; I learned the chief fondak or
caravansary was kept by one Muley Mustapha el Hamisi; but most
unluckily an unkind fate deprived me of the opportunity of
entering his hospitable walls.&nbsp; The city seemed to resemble,
from the account of the Sherif, Morocco city, that is, to occupy
a relatively enormous space, as almost every other house had a
large garden, and several of the larger houses gardens of many
acres in extent; so that, as the Sherif explained, &ldquo;the
town looks like a silver cup <a name="citation164a"></a><a
href="#footnote164a" class="citation">[164a]</a> dropped in a
tuft of grass.&rdquo;&nbsp; This, as I did not see it, I take on
trust, believing perhaps that Moses had died happier had he not
had the view from Pisgah&rsquo;s summit over the plains of
Canaan. <a name="citation164b"></a><a href="#footnote164b"

<p>And so the Governors waited on patiently, their followers
almost starving, and I expect themselves not too much fed, for
the Kaid&rsquo;s servants ate or sold all the provisions which
the Chamberlain issued each day to feed the various
&ldquo;guests.&rdquo;&nbsp; How the poor devils in the prison
underground fared I do not know, but now and then a bucket with
bread and couscousou was let down to them, and I believe they
flew on it like half-starved jackals on a dead donkey outside a
Moorish town.&nbsp; Although a semi-prisoner, the Sherif from Sus
was still a holy man, and therefore I sent <a
name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>Mohammed-el-Hosein to take refuge with him till all
talk of fetters, dungeons, stick and shaving beards was
past.&nbsp; This taking refuge (to &ldquo;zoug,&rdquo; as it is
called) is common in Morocco.&nbsp; At times upon a journey, some
man will rush and seize your stirrup, and will not let go till
you promise him protection, which, when you do (for it is not
easy to refuse), you make yourself an Old Man of the Sea, an
Incubus, who has proprietary rights in you, and perhaps follows
you to your journey&rsquo;s end.</p>
<p>The patience of the three Sheikhs gave me an example, and I
endeavoured to take our enforced detention as quietly as they
did, though without success.&nbsp; It was truly wonderful to see
them sitting all day long, half-starved, outside their tent,
taking the sun and praying regularly, yet without ostentation,
telling their beads, listening to the Sherif read in a low voice
from his little sacred book, and praising Allah (I have no doubt)
consumedly.</p>
<p>And so the day went past without an incident, except that
towards evening, as they drove the cattle home, two tame
moufflons came with them, as goats do in a field at home.&nbsp;
These moufflons (Oudad) are rather larger than a large goat,
almost the colour of a Scotch red deer; a tuft of hair about a
span in length grows on their withers and on their dewlap is
another of the same size; the eyes are large and full, and very
wide, and their chief feature is an enormous pair of curving
horns.&nbsp; A wandering Sherif (in this case a kind of fakir)
from Taserouelt told me that &ldquo;they often throw themselves
off a cliff a hundred feet in height, and fall upon their horns,
and then jump up at once, and run off faster than gazelles run
when the hunter shouts to his horse.&rdquo;&nbsp; Just before
evening we met the Kaid&rsquo;s secretary, a quiet, handsome,
literary man, who came and sat with us, and talked long about
books, and grew quite friendly with Lutaif <a
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>on his
producing the poems of el Faredi. <a name="citation166a"></a><a
href="#footnote166a" class="citation">[166a]</a>&nbsp; They read
aloud alternately in a sort of rhythmic sing-song way, pleasing
to listen to, and which is taught in Arab schools.&nbsp; Though I
did not understand more than a word in five, the language is so
fine, I enjoyed it more than all the matchless eloquence of a
debate in Parliament.</p>
<p>To read in Arabic is a set art; to read and understand a
different branch of scholarship; but these two Talebs both read
and understood, and after an hour&rsquo;s intonation, strophe
about, they marvelled at one another&rsquo;s learning, and like
two doughty chieftains in an Homeric fight, stopped often to
compliment and flatter one another.&nbsp; &ldquo;By Allah, it
seems impossible a Christian can read and understand el
Faredi.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Strange that a Taleb of the Atlas
should know the literal <a name="citation166b"></a><a
href="#footnote166b" class="citation">[166b]</a> language as if
he were an Eastern&rdquo; <a name="citation166c"></a><a
href="#footnote166c" class="citation">[166c]</a> and the
like.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Taleb of the Atlas&rdquo; explained he had
been the pilgrimage, and lived two years in Mecca, and whilst
there (although a Berber) had studied deeply and perfected
himself in the knowledge of the East as far as possible.&nbsp;
Lutaif explained that though a Christian he was of Arab race, and
that he worshipped God, as &ldquo;Allah,&rdquo; in the same way
as did Mohammedans.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the Taleb,
half laughing, &ldquo;either you are a Moslem in disguise, or
else a Taleb who has become a Christian.&rdquo;&nbsp; Seeing the
conversation was becoming rather strained, I interrupted and
broke it up; but when the Taleb left, Lutaif borrowed my knife
and managed to haggle off his beard, though not without abrasion
of the cuticle, and though without it he looked less like an <a
name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>Arab, still
with his moustache, which he refused to sacrifice, he looked so
like a Turk that, as regards appearance, little was gained by all
his sufferings.</p>
<p>The next day found us with the same postal address, still
without having seen the Kaid, and without a definite idea of his
intentions.&nbsp; Most of the people seemed to be certain that a
messenger had gone to the Sultan for instructions on our case,
but both the Chamberlain, the Taleb, and the Captain of the Guard
denied with circumstance, and perjured themselves as cheerfully,
and with as much delight in perjury for the mere sake of perjury,
as any minister answering a question from the front bench of the
grandmother of all parliaments.&nbsp; We passed the time reading
el Faredi and an Arabic version of the Psalms; writing and
smoking, walking up and down the Maidan, sitting underneath the
trees, and watching the Kaid&rsquo;s horses and mules being
driven to the river to bathe and drink.&nbsp; Although a Berber
and a mountaineer, the Kaid was fond of horses, and had a stud of
about eighty horses and as many mules.&nbsp; Negroes led down the
horses all &ldquo;lither-fat,&rdquo; for our lord the Kaid had
&ldquo;long lain in,&rdquo; and there had been no riding in the
glen for the past month.&nbsp; Blacks, bays, and chestnuts, with
a white or two, and a light cream colour of the kind called by
the Spaniards &ldquo;Huevo de pato,&rdquo; that is duck&rsquo;s
egg.&nbsp; All rather &ldquo;chunky,&rdquo; as the Texans say,
some running up to about sixteen hands, mostly all with long
tails sweeping upon the ground and manes which fell quite to the
point of the shoulder in the older horses.&nbsp; Their tails all
set on low (a mark of the Barb breed), their eyes large and
prominent, heads rather large, ears long, thin and intelligent,
always in motion, backs rather short, round in the barrel, and
well ribbed up, straight in the pastern, and feet rather small
and high, the consequence of being bred on stony ground.</p>
<p><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>I
learned the black <a name="citation168a"></a><a
href="#footnote168a" class="citation">[168a]</a> (el Dum) is best
for show, but bad in temper, especially if he has no white hairs
about him.&nbsp; Ride him not to war, for when the sun shines
hot, and water is hard to find, he cannot suffer, and leaves his
rider in the power of his enemy.&nbsp; Still the black without
moon or stars (white hairs) is a horse for kings, but he fears
rocky ground.&nbsp; The chestnut <a name="citation168b"></a><a
href="#footnote168b" class="citation">[168b]</a> when he flies
beneath the sun, it is the wind.&nbsp; It was a favourite colour
with the Prophet, and therefore to be desired of all good Moslems
and good horsemen.</p>
<p>The roan is a pool of blood, his rider will be overtaken but
will never overtake.&nbsp; The light chestnut (Zfar el Jehudi,
the Jews&rsquo; yellow) is not for men to ride, he brings ill
luck.&nbsp; No wise man would ride a horse with a white spot in
front of the saddle, for such a horse is as fatal as the most
violent poison.&nbsp; In the same way no prudent man would buy a
horse with a white face and stockings, for he carries his own
shroud with him.</p>
<p>The white is a colour for princes, but not for war.&nbsp; When
you advance afar off your enemy makes ready for you.</p>
<p>The bay is the pearl of colours, for the bay is hardiest and
most sober of all horses.&nbsp; Says the Emir Abd-el-Kader,
&ldquo;If they tell you a horse jumped down a precipice without
injury, ask if he was a bay, and if they answer yes, believe
them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Lastly, the Emir says with reason,
&ldquo;Speak to your horses as a man speaks to his child, and
they will correct their faults which have incurred your anger,
for they understand the mouth of man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Armed with these maxims and on the look-out for others, I was
not dull as long as the horses were in sight.&nbsp; Sometimes a
boy would ride them in to swim in the swift current, snorting and
plunging till they lost their feet, and then their heads appeared
out of the <a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
169</span>water, their backs almost awash, the boys clinging to
them like monkeys as they struck out for the bank, raising a wave
like small torpedo boats.&nbsp; At other times two would break
loose and fight, screaming and standing up, or rushing in, seize
one another by the necks like bulldogs, when their respective
negroes dodged outside, like forward players in a football
scrimmage waiting for the ball, trying to catch their ropes but
afraid to venture in between them.&nbsp; Generally the fight was
ended by an Arab or a Berber rushing up armed with a thick stick
and a handful of round stones, with which he beat and pelted them
till they let go their hold.&nbsp; Others again would break loose
all alone, and career about the sandy beach, head and tail up, or
gallop through the corn, their attendant running after them in
agony till they were captured.&nbsp; The most sedate walked
delicately as they were Agags down to the water, plunged their
muzzles deep into the stream and drank as if they wished to drain
the river dry, looked up and drank again three times, then
turned, and after executing several perfunctory bounds, lay down
and rolled in the wet sand and quietly walked home beside their
negro, not deigning even to look at any other horse, then
disappeared under the horseshoe gateway to the inner courtyard
where they lived.&nbsp; The mules were not so interesting, though
valuable, fetching more money than the best horse, and if
accomplished &ldquo;pacers,&rdquo; often bringing two or three
hundred dollars, whereas a horse rarely exceeds a hundred and
fifty at the most; but still they have an air as of a donkey,
which makes them quite uninteresting, for they are lacking in the
donkey&rsquo;s inner grace.</p>
<p>In districts like the Atlas mules are more serviceable than
any horse, and on the mountain roads will perform almost a third
longer journey in a day.&nbsp; Where the horse beats them is on
the plain, for no mule can live beside a horse at the
horse&rsquo;s pace, <a name="page170"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>though on a rough road the
mule&rsquo;s pace is much the faster of the two.&nbsp; Sometimes
five or six mules would break loose and follow one another in a
string, jumping the thorny fences heavily, their ears flapping
about ridiculously, and their thin tails stuck high up in the
air.&nbsp; They never swam, and, on the whole, had I been limited
to mules exclusively, I could not have passed my time so
well.&nbsp; One horse especially interested me, a large
creamy-white animal with an immense and curly mane; he always
came alone, led by two negroes, and had an open wound upon his
head and two upon his chest.&nbsp; I learned he was the
Kaid&rsquo;s special favourite, and that about a month ago,
during an expedition to the Sus to aid the Sultan against a
refractory tribe, the Kaid had received a bullet in the leg, and
the horse had got his wounds at the same time.&nbsp; None of the
horses that I saw would be of any value, except to an artist, in
the European market; but for the country where they were bred
they were most serviceable, hardy, and indefatigable, sober
beyond belief, eating their corn but once a day, drinking but
once, and up to any weight, and if not quite so fast as might be
wished for, still a glory to the eye.</p>
<p>The horses gone, the entertainment of the day was over, and I
got quite accustomed to expect them at a certain hour, and to be
quite annoyed if they were late.</p>
<p>Thus did one day tell and certify another, leaving us quite
cut off from all the world, as far removed from European
influence as we had been in the centre of the Sahara; well
treated, but uncertain of how long we should be kept in
honourable captivity, growing more anxious every moment, and yet
with something comic in the situation; nothing to do but make the
best of it, eat, drink, and sleep, and stroll about, talk with
the natives, sit in our tent, and read el Faredi, giving
ourselves up with the best grace we could, to watching and to
prayer.</p>
<h2><a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
171</span>CHAPTER VII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> 24th still found us, so to
speak, in Poste Restante at Kintafi, the Kaid invisible, tobacco
running low, food not too regular, and our animals becoming
thinner every day.&nbsp; Still the example of the prisoners, the
Sheikhs from Sus, and a tent full of miserable tribesmen, all
almost without food, and glad to eat our scraps, kept us for
shame&rsquo;s sake patient.&nbsp; So we talked much to everyone,
especially with the negro who had been in London, and found he
was a man of much and varied travel, some experience, no little
observation, and ready to talk all day on all that he had
seen.&nbsp; London had not impressed him, or else impressed him
to such purpose that he was dumb about it; but of the Fetish
worshippers below the Senegal he could tell much.&nbsp; In
speaking of them, though a negro of the blackest dye, he treated
them as savages, being a Mohammedan, and laughed at their
religion, although the most foolish portions of it seemed to
appeal to his imagination, in the same way that negroes in
America (all Christians, of course), are seldom pleased with
moderate Christianity, but usually are Ranters, Bush Baptists, or
members of some saltatory sect, which gives them opportunity to
enter more fully into communion with the spirit of the thing than
if they sat and listened to a prayer, slept at a sermon, or
dropped their money in the plate, merely conforming in a
perfunctory way, as their less animistic lower-toned brethren in
the Lord seem quite content to do.</p>
<p><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>Fetish, our friend explained, is good, and works great
deeds; sometimes a man will die, and then the Fetish man appears
and cuts off a cow&rsquo;s tail, fastens it on the dead
man&rsquo;s forehead, who at once gets up and walks to where he
wishes to be buried, and dies again.&nbsp; Why he does this the
speaker did not know, or why, before he dies, the man does not
explain in the usual way to his friends where he wants them to
lay him after death.&nbsp; Nor did he know what good the fetish
man receives by his operation, or if the tail should be taken
from a dead or living cow; but he was certain that he had seen a
miracle, and told us plainly that he never was so certain of
anything before.&nbsp; Fetish to him seemed rather an incident
than a religion, for he went on to say the heathen negroes have
no God, just like the Christians; and then turned grey, which, I
think, is the negro way to blush, and said, he did not point his
observation at ourselves, for he had heard in London that we
worshipped several Gods, and that the Christians he referred to
were the people in the Canaries, who, he was positive, worshipped
a goddess, for he had seen them do so in a Mosque.&nbsp; Again he
said his head was full of news, but his purse still continued
light, and so he drew it out and showed it to us, and it was
empty certainly; but beautifully made, of a most curious pattern
and workmanship, and cunningly contrived of pieces of thin
leather which all fitted into one another and drew out, after the
fashion of those painted boxes which used to come from India,
which in one&rsquo;s childhood when one opened them, one always
found another underneath.&nbsp; It appears he has been often in
the Canaries, and knows the islands, as Lanzarote which he
denominates &ldquo;Charuta,&rdquo; Fuerteventura which becomes
&ldquo;Fortinvantora,&rdquo; and Grand Canary, where he saw one
Christian kill another with a knife.</p>
<p>In form he was almost perfect as a type of race; <a
name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>blacker
than shale, with yellowish teeth like fangs, nostrils as wide as
a small donkey&rsquo;s, huge ears like a young elephant&rsquo;s,
and bloodshot eyes, thin, spindle legs, and all his body covered
with old scars; for he had been in many wars,
&ldquo;shoots,&rdquo; as he said &ldquo;plum center&rdquo;; rides
well, and to crown all had feet about the size and shape of a
cigar box, stuck at right angles to his legs, so when he walked
he looked like a flamingo, or a heron in a swamp.&nbsp; Knowing
by actual handling the exiguity of his purse, I approached the
negro to try if he would carry letters for me to the outside
world.&nbsp; But after having bargained for five dollars, a
sudden panic took him, and he refused, and ever after during our
stay avoided us, although I did not hear that he informed the
Kaid or any of his men.</p>
<p>All the day long a constant string of people kept arriving at
the castle gate.&nbsp; Little brown sturdy-legged Berber
tribesmen, armed with long quarter-staffs, dressed in their dark
&ldquo;achnifs,&rdquo; barefooted and bareheaded, save for a
string of camel&rsquo;s hair bound round the forehead;
small-eyed, and strangely autochthonous in type, as if they and
the stones upon the hills had sprung into existence long before
history.&nbsp; Small caravans of donkeys carrying Indian corn,
with fruit, with almonds, and with meat entered the gate full
laden, and came out empty.&nbsp; Negresses walked down the hill
tracks, bending beneath the weight of immense loads of brushwood,
or of grass, or the green leaves of Indian corn or sorgum, <a
name="citation173"></a><a href="#footnote173"
class="citation">[173]</a> to feed the horses, and to heat the
ovens of the Kaid.</p>
<p>I found that, though the Kaid oppressed and plundered all the
district, his oppression was in a measure balanced by his
charity, for he fed all the poor people <a
name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>of the
valley, and dispensed his hospitality to all and sundry who
passed his gates.&nbsp; So that, take it for all in all, his
tyranny was only different in degree from that of the
manufacturer in the manufacturing towns of England, who lives
upon the toil of several thousand workmen, discharges no one
useful function to the State, his works being run by paid
officials, and he himself doing nothing but sign his letters,
whilst he uses the money wrung from his workmen to engage in
foreign speculations, to swindle the inhabitants of distant
countries; and for all charity subscribes to missions to convert
the Jews, or to send meddling praters to insult good Catholics in
Spain.</p>
<p>The Kaid, Si Taib el Kintafi, lives like a veritable prince,
is almost independent of the Sultan, and reminds me of a
Mohammedan Emir in Spain after the Caliphate of Cordoba broke
up.&nbsp; These Emirs were called by the Spaniards Reyezuelos de
Taifas, <a name="citation174a"></a><a href="#footnote174a"
class="citation">[174a]</a> that is, Kings of a Section, or Hedge
Kings; they had their courts in Jaen, in Malaga, in Almeria, <a
name="citation174b"></a><a href="#footnote174b"
class="citation">[174b]</a> and in the South of Portugal.&nbsp;
But in especial it recalled Jaen, being situated amongst the
mountains, as that kingdom was with towering Atalayas
(watch-towers) on every hill, and the Kaid&rsquo;s palace in the
centre of the land.&nbsp; Guards were on every road patrolling
within sight of one another.&nbsp; About five hundred negro
slaves were scattered in the various castles.&nbsp; The Kaid kept
all his money in iron boxes underground, and all his wives were
guarded by gentlemen of the third sex, <a
name="citation174c"></a><a href="#footnote174c"
class="citation">[174c]</a> so that the parallel between Kintafi
and Jaen was almost perfect.&nbsp; For enemies he had the Sultan
and every other Kaid of equal strength, but the <a
name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
175</span>impenetrable nature of his territory made him almost
impregnable, and the armed soldiery, who lounged about in numbers
round the castle and at every fort, made him secure as long as he
could pay their services.&nbsp; The difference between a
Spanish-Moorish mountain State and the Taifa of Kintafi was
(though not apparent in externals, in policy, and in ideals of
government), in other matters, very striking, for in the smallest
Moorish Courts of Spain arts, sciences, literature, and general
culture all flourished, and were encouraged by the kings.</p>
<p>Poets, musicians, doctors, and men of science flocked to the
capitals; both Almeria and Malaga were centres of culture, and
the works of many writers who flourished in those cities still
survive.&nbsp; But in Kintafi all was in decadence; for music,
only a little thrumming on the gimbri, <a
name="citation175"></a><a href="#footnote175"
class="citation">[175]</a> beating of tom-toms, an occasional
song sung to the lute, and the shrill music of the Moorish pipe
known as the Ghaita, and which survives in parts of Spain under
the name of Dulzaina.&nbsp; In both countries it is always
accompanied by a small hand-drum.</p>
<p>Literature, in the modern Moorish State, is confined but to
the Koran, the sacred books, an occasional Arab poet, and the
study of the one book known to be written in the Berber tongue,
and called El Maziri, which deals exclusively with the ceremonial
of the faith.&nbsp; Strange that a people like the Moors, still
brave, so fine in type, ardent in faith, sober in habit, and
apparently (if history lie not more than usually) so like to what
they were externally, when they shook Europe, should have fallen
into such absolute decay.&nbsp; Literature, art, science,
everything is forgotten; architecture but a base copy of their
older styles, though <a name="page176"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 176</span>still not so degraded as our own;
bad government cries aloud in every town, on every road
corruption runs rampant, and still the people, as mere men, are
infinitely superior to any race in Europe I have seen; patient,
and bearing hunger and oppression with a patience to put a saint
to shame, and yet incapable of striking a blow to free themselves
from the base tyranny which all must see and feel.</p>
<p>No man in all Morocco to rise and say, as the Sheikhs said to
Omar when he asked if any one had a complaint against him:
&ldquo;By Allah, if we had had cause of complaint against thee,
we had redressed it with our swords.&rdquo;&nbsp; And still, in
spite of decadence, I never met a Moor who knew anything of our
European life and institutions, except, of course, the servant
class and a few men in place, and money-lenders, who wished to
change their decadence for our prosperity upon the terms of
bowing to a foreign race.&nbsp; They know that to the individual
man, with all its faults, their life is happier than
ours&mdash;somehow they feel instinctively that when we talk of
freedom, liberty, and of good government, these mean freedom,
good government and liberty for ourselves, and that they, by
submitting, would become slaves, receiving nothing in
return.&nbsp; Still they accept our gin, our teas, our powder,
and in general, all the good things which Europe sends them, with
civility; but decline to see that we, for all our talk, are any
better than themselves.&nbsp; Baulked of our negro, I cast about
to find some other stranger willing to earn a dishonest penny by
carrying letters for the prisoners of the Kaid.&nbsp; After much
talking and long negotiation overnight, a man made up his mind to
venture to Morocco city, a journey of about three days, for the
magnificent guerdon of four dollars, one dollar to be paid at
once, and the other three upon arrival, either at Mr.
Nairn&rsquo;s, the missionary&rsquo;s, house, or that of Si Bu
Bekr, a <a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>well-known merchant, and for a long time British Agent
in the town, or at the house of the Sherif of Tamasluoght, a
protected British subject, whose Zowia is about ten miles outside
the town.</p>
<p>The letters duly written, with much care and secrecy, some to
our friends, others to consuls, one to the British Minister in
Tangier, and two <a name="citation177"></a><a href="#footnote177"
class="citation">[177]</a> to newspapers, were wrapped up
carefully in a piece of strong French packing paper, tied round
with a palmetto cord, and given to the man, who crawled up to the
tent door at dead of night, whilst we sat waiting for him like
conspirators.&nbsp; At the last moment, he demanded &ldquo;one
more dollar in the hand,&rdquo; dwelling upon the risks he ran,
and which, indeed, were great.&nbsp; Not being prepared to
bargain at such a time, I put the dollar in his hand, and bade
him go with God, telling Mohammed-el-Hosein to explain in Berber
all that he should do.&nbsp; They seemed to talk for hours,
though I suppose it was not really long, and after having
received instructions, minute enough to confuse a lawyer, he
slipped away, crawling along the ground (his single long white
garment looking like a shroud), until he reached a bank beside
the mill stream, over which he dropped.</p>
<p>We sat late, talking over our tea, smoked the last of our
tobacco, and calculated how long it would take to get an answer,
if all went well, and if our messenger escaped the perils of the
road.&nbsp; Mohammed-el-Hosein thought in five days, if in the
interim it did not rain, and the rivers rise, we might have word,
&ldquo;for,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;when the man arrives, either
the missionary or Bu Bekr, or both, will send off messengers both
to the Consul, to the Sultan, and another to the Kaid to tell him
where we are.&nbsp; The messengers,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;having
their own spurs and other people&rsquo;s horses, will not spare
either, so that upon the evening of the fifth day we shall hear,
Inshallah, if all goes well.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>All
the night long we slept but little, fearing to hear shots and see
our guide brought back escorted by a guard, but all passed
quietly, and we congratulated ourselves on his escape, as we knew
well the first ten miles of the road would be most difficult for
him to pass.</p>
<p>Next morning we kept wondering, like children, how far our
messenger had got upon the road, and trying to encourage one
another by talking of the tremendous distance an Arab
&ldquo;rekass&rdquo; could go when pushed to exert himself by
fear or gain.&nbsp; The stories grew as the morning passed, until
at last from eighty to a hundred miles seemed quite an ordinary
trot.&nbsp; Privately, I thought the thick-legged mountaineer did
not look like a record breaker, but I kept my opinion to myself,
and let my followers yarn, seeing that it relieved their
hearts.&nbsp; By this time, Mohammed-el-Hosein had ventured back
from his refuge with the Sherif from Sus, and was quite sure that
the Kaid had sent a messenger off to the Sultan, for, on the
morning after we were captured, a &ldquo;rekass&rdquo; was seen
to strike across the hills.&nbsp; The Chamberlain, <a
name="citation178"></a><a href="#footnote178"
class="citation">[178]</a> Si Mohammed, honoured us with a visit,
wrapped up in fleecy, voluminous white clothes, new yellow shoes,
beard dyed with henna, finger nails turned orange with the same
substance, and followed by two stalwart, well-armed mountaineers,
who strode behind him as he waddled to our tent.&nbsp; After due
compliments and salutations, he officially informed us that the
Kaid was wounded, and could not see us for a day or two.&nbsp;
Though we knew this before, to show good manners, we pretended
great astonishment, asked who could have dared to wound so good a
prince, where it had happened, and as to seeing us, begged he
would use his pleasure in the <a name="page179"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 179</span>matter, though, of course, we
counted every minute, till we should see his face.&nbsp; The
Chamberlain, as excellent a diplomatist as could be wished for,
said he was glad to see us in such spirits, for he had thought by
my expression on the first day, that I was irritated with his
lord, the Kaid, who had detained us (as he now said) merely to
save our lives, as, had we crossed into the Sus, the
&ldquo;Illegitimate Ones&rdquo; (Oulad el Haram) would have slain
us, not for Christians, &ldquo;for,&rdquo; said the Chamberlain,
looking at me with a slight smile, &ldquo;you wear our clothes as
if you had been born amongst the Arabs,&rdquo; but as strangers,
for God had made their hearts like stone to all they did not
know.&nbsp; The conversation languished till he startled me by
asking if I was a Moskou, which at first I did not comprehend,
and thought he meant to ask me of what sect I was.&nbsp; Just as
I had instructed Lutaif to inform him I was a member of the U.P.
<a name="citation179a"></a><a href="#footnote179a"
class="citation">[179a]</a> Church, and was as orthodox <a
name="citation179b"></a><a href="#footnote179b"
class="citation">[179b]</a> a Christian as he was a Mohammedan,
it dawned upon me that he meant to ask me if I was a Russian, and
might have said I was one, had I not feared to bring about a
diplomatic question of some sort.&nbsp; Our guns against the
tent-pole next struck his eye.&nbsp; Mine was a double-barrelled
gun lent by the British Consul in Mogador.&nbsp; Lutaif&rsquo;s,
a single barrelled, Spanish gun, made in Barcelona, and so light
upon the trigger, that on the only occasion he tried to fire with
it, it started before he was expecting it, and the whole charge
passed close to the head of an old <a name="page180"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 180</span>negro on a donkey passing along the
road.&nbsp; The negro did not turn a hair, but was just starting
to abuse Lutaif, when, in my capacity of a Sherif, I rode up and
cursed him for a dog for getting between the gun and the
partridge Lutaif was firing at.&nbsp; This made things right, and
the poor man rode on with many apologies for having frightened
us.&nbsp; The Chamberlain examined the two weapons, and asked
leave to show them to the Kaid, and, before we had time to
answer, motioned to one of his attendants to take them off.&nbsp;
I sat as solid as a rock, and said it was not usual to deprive a
guest of his gun without consent, whereupon the Chamberlain
poured out a torrent of excuses, and said the Kaid had now
determined not to hurt a hair of any of our heads, and only
wanted to see the guns from curiosity.&nbsp; Seeing the turn
events were taking, I tried to get the Chamberlain to say if a
&ldquo;rekass&rdquo; had been sent off to the Sultan or not, and
if it was not possible for him to use his influence (for a
consideration) to enable us to go on to the Sus.</p>
<p>Tipping through the East is understood to the full as well as
it is understood in England, and his eyes glistened at the word
&ldquo;consideration,&rdquo; but with an effort he replied, as
far as he knew no messenger had gone, and, as to going to the
Sus, had he not told us of the Sons of Belial who in that land
cared for men&rsquo;s lives as little as an ordinary man cared
about killing lice?&nbsp; After some tea and a surreptitious
cigarette which I found in the corner of my saddlebag, and which
to make him smoke we had to close the tent, so that no one should
see him &ldquo;drink the shameful,&rdquo; he departed, telling us
to be of good cheer and we should soon be honoured by an
interview with his liege lord the Kaid.&nbsp; As he departed I
responded to his compliments ceremoniously in English, devoting
his liege lord to all the devils mentioned in the <a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>Talmud,
Cabala, Apocalypse, and other works upon theology which treat of
angels, devils, and like works of human ingenuity.&nbsp; Lutaif
almost exploded, and even Swani, who knew a little expletive
English, seemed amused.</p>
<p>After the interview we walked up the river and sat down
underneath an algarroba tree, to watch thirty or forty people,
men, children, and women, more or less carelessly veiled (for in
this matter Berbers are much less strict than Arabs), all
cracking almonds in a long open shed.</p>
<p>Almonds are one of the staple articles of trade in the Atlas
Mountains.&nbsp; Long trains of mules, during the autumn, convey
them to Morocco city; from thence they go to Mogador and are
shipped off to Europe, &ldquo;though what you Christians do with
such a quantity of almonds we do not know.&rdquo;&nbsp; I took
especial care not to enquire the price per bag, or ton, or box,
they sell at; how many qualities there are; when they are ripe;
how they are picked, sorted, or anything of that fatiguing
nature, knowing how much I had disliked that kind of thing in
books of travel I have read.&nbsp; Is not all that set forth in
Consular Reports, in Blue Books, and the like, and who am I, by
means of information got meanly at first hand, to
&ldquo;blackleg,&rdquo; so to speak, upon a British Consul, or to
&ldquo;springe cockle in his cleene corne&rdquo; with unofficial
and uncalled details which would not bring me in a cent?</p>
<p>Lutaif, and I, the Sherif from Sus, and the Persian, sat under
a walnut grove for several hours, reading el Faredi, trying to
learn the Berber tongue, talking of things and others, and I
began at last to understand the lives passed by the Greek
philosophers, who no doubt wandered up and down talking of things
they did not understand, dozing beneath the trees, and weaving
theories about First Causes, Atoms, Evolution, the Nature of the
Gods, Schemes of Creation, and other <a name="page182"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 182</span>mental exercises, at least as
interesting as essays upon View of Frank Pledge (Visus de
Francopledgii), Courts of Attachment, Swanimote, or any of the
Judgments or the Entries of the Assizes of the Forest, either of
Pickering or Lancaster.</p>
<p>Much did the Sherif enquire about the &ldquo;Chimin di
fer&rdquo;&mdash;how it was made, how fast it went and why, and
if men sat upon it (as he had heard) and worked it with their
legs.&nbsp; I told him all I knew (and more), and about bicycles
and women&rsquo;s rights; gave a brief digest of our common law
and current theology, tried to explain our parliamentary system,
the Stock Exchange, our commerce, glory, whisky, and the like;
told him of London&rsquo;s streets at night, our churches,
chapels, underground railways, tramways, telephones, electric
light, and other trifles of our pomp and state which might be
interesting.&nbsp; His observations were few but pertinent, and
certainly, upon occasions, hard to answer out of hand.&nbsp; The
bicycle, the Persian kindly corroborated; the telephone, Lutaif
explained; a railway underground was no more wonderful than one
upon the surface of the earth; our parliament seemed foolish to
him, and he could not understand how one man could represent
another, still less ten thousand men; the Stock Exchange he
summed up briefly as a fraud, remarking, &ldquo;How can they sell
that which they have not got?&rdquo; but he reserved his chiefest
comment for more simple things.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whose are those
wives,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;who walk your streets?&nbsp; I
thought you Christians were monogamists.&nbsp; Do you not keep
the law you follow then, or are there not sufficient husbands for
the women, or are your women bad by nature; and how is it your
Cadis tolerate such things?&rdquo;&nbsp; I told him, courteous
reader, just what you would have said in my position; confessed
our faith in strict monogamy, but said the flesh was weak; that
even amongst ourselves the Oulad-el-Haram were a large <a
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>tribe; that
all worked towards perfection, and no doubt, some day, things
would improve.&nbsp; He quite courteously rejoined, &ldquo;Yes,
yes, I see, you Christians are like us; that is, your faith is
stronger than your deeds; well, even with us there are some men
who read the Koran, and yet forget to follow all it
says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I dropped the conversation and urged the old Persian on to
talk about himself; to tell of Persia, Turkey, the Sahara, and
the Oasis of Tindoof, which he described by smoothing his hand
upon the sand to show the flatness of it, and then said
&ldquo;Tindoof walou,&rdquo; that is, in Tindoof, nothing; though
he confessed it is the mouth of Timbuctoo.&nbsp; In the same way
Canada is said to have got its name from the two Spanish words
&ldquo;Aca&rdquo; and &ldquo;Nada,&rdquo; as signifying
&ldquo;there is nothing here.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Baris,&rdquo;
<a name="citation183"></a><a href="#footnote183"
class="citation">[183]</a> he said was beautiful, the houris as
the houris in paradise, but more expensive; and he detailed with
great astonishment that once on entering a &ldquo;cabinet&rdquo;
(presumably inodore) he had to pay a franc on coming out.&nbsp;
And still he dwelt upon our hardness towards our co-religionists,
and said, &ldquo;Amongst you, look how many starve; here they may
kill us, or throw us into prison, mutilate us, put out our eyes
(these things are all against the Koran, as your women on the
streets are clean against the teachings of your Book), but who
can say a poor Mohammedan was ever known to starve?&nbsp; Look at
me here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I came walking along the road
carrying my broken fiddle, not cursing God, after the fashion of
the Christians, for my bad luck, but praying at the Saint&rsquo;s
tomb, leading the prayer in wayside mosques, calling to prayers
when asked, maintained by all, till I arrived at this place and
was received by the great Kaid with favour, given <a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>food and
clothes and twenty dollars, <a name="citation184"></a><a
href="#footnote184" class="citation">[184]</a> and fell into the
disgrace in which you see me by my own act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though I knew of the Kaid&rsquo;s face being averted from him,
and that he was about once more to take his fiddle up and walk, I
had, out of politeness, to pretend my ignorance, and then he
spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I was well received, and nightly the Kaid would
send for me, and I discoursed to him of Persia, Turkey, and other
countries which I had seen, and also of El Hind and China which I
have not visited, but trust to visit before I call myself a
traveller, and all went well and others envied me.&nbsp; Till, on
a night, puffed up with pride, I let my tongue escape.&nbsp;
Unruly member!&nbsp; (Here he drew it out and held it, like a
slippery fish, between his finger and his thumb.)&nbsp; With it I
told the Kaid that he might be as a great Sultan, but that I was
greater, for was not I a Sultan of the mind? and since that time
I have not stood once in the presence, and shortly I shall leave
this place without a friend unless it be that you and this same
noble Syrian, who speaks for you, can be counted in the number of
the men who wish me well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He ceased and I determined later on to take the hint, and fell
awatching a small brown tree-creeper, not larger than a wren,
which ran along the branches of a walnut-tree, and put its head
upon one side and looked at us as it had been a fashionable
philosopher, and no doubt just as wise.&nbsp; The grove of
walnuts, sound of the running stream, at which a large grey
squirrel sat and drank, noise of the wind amongst the leaves, the
distant glimpses of the snow-capped hills, the long sustained
notes of the negroes singing in the fields, set me athinking upon
some not impossible Almighty Power, a harmony in things, a not
altogether improbable design in nature, and, in fact, <a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>embarked me
on the train of thought which the deep-thinking author of the
libretto of &ldquo;Girofl&eacute;e et Girofla&rdquo; has typified
as thoughts about &ldquo;de l&rsquo;eau, de l&rsquo;amour, des
roses,&rdquo; etc., when the irruption of a scabby-headed boy
summoned me back to earth.</p>
<p>He (the scabby-headed one) had heard I was a doctor of some
repute, and had cured divers folks, as, indeed, I think I had, or
at least medicined them out of self-conceit, and came to ask my
help for the affliction which had come upon his head.&nbsp;
Taking rather a hasty look, I almost had prescribed washing and
an ointment with some butter mixed with sulphur, when I bethought
me what was expected of a doctor in the country where we
lived.&nbsp; So, after thinking carefully for a little space, I
said, &ldquo;This requires thought, come to the tent in two
hours&rsquo; time (three hours were better), and I hope by then
to have thought out, Inshallah, a fit medicine for your
case.&rdquo;&nbsp; Duly interpreted into Berber this satisfied
him, and he promised to comply.&nbsp; Our <i>tertulia</i> <a
name="citation185"></a><a href="#footnote185"
class="citation">[185]</a> then dispersed, and we went back to
sleep inside the tent, or resting on our rugs, to watch the
constant passing stream of white or brown-dressed, bare-footed
figures that, in Morocco, is always to be seen passing upon every
road.</p>
<p>Considering that, in the Romans&rsquo; time, Pliny, quoting
from the lost journal of Suetonius Paulinus, informs us that the
Atlas Mountains were full of elephants, and swarmed with wild
beasts of every kind, who took refuge in the impenetrable forests
with which those mountains then were clad, it is strange to find
the Atlas of to-day so largely a treeless and a gameless
land.&nbsp; True, that much later than the Roman <a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>times, the
white wild cattle, now confined to Cadzow, Chillingham, and Lyme,
roamed through the glades of Epping Forest, where to-day nothing
more fearful than sandwich paper, or a broken bottle, makes
afraid the explorer, and that wolves and wild boars were common
till almost modern times with us.&nbsp; The destruction of the
forests can be accounted for by the constant burning for
pasturage, and with the forests much of the game would go, but
why, besides large animals, there should be a dearth of birds, I
do not know.&nbsp; With the exception of a hawk or two, pigeons
and partridges, the lesser bustard, the little tree-creeper,
before referred to, a species of grey wagtails, and a
reddish-brown sparrow, I hardly saw a bird.&nbsp; The ibises that
follow cattle, the wild ducks, water birds, the greater bustard,
herons and large hawks, all so common in the plains, are here
conspicuous by their absence.&nbsp; I saw no storks, <a
name="citation186"></a><a href="#footnote186"
class="citation">[186]</a> and I believe they rarely come so high
into the mountains as Kintafi, though in the plains no Arab hut
so small as not to have its nest, with its two storks chattering
all day, quite as persistently, and as far as I can see, to quite
as little purpose as do members of the Imperial Parliament.</p>
<p>As regards animals&mdash;hyenas, foxes, jackals, wild boars,
moufflons, porcupines, grey squirrels, small hares, and rabbits
in considerable numbers, are to be found, with a few wild cats,
and now and then a panther; lions are unknown, except in the
great cedar forests of the Beni M&rsquo;Gild to the north of
Fez.&nbsp; In many parts of the plain country of Morocco the
animals above referred to (except the lion), but with the
addition of the gazelle, are numerous, but in the <a
name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>Atlas
Mountains, at least about Kintafi, they are scarce and hard to
find.&nbsp; In the plains sand grouse and several kinds of
plovers are frequent, but I never saw them in the hills.&nbsp;
Certainly both in the mountains and the plains all men have guns,
and some of them shoot well; but though they shoot partridges,
ducks, and pigeons in the plains, and in the mountains hunt the
moufflon, and the wild boar and porcupine, I never saw an Arab or
a Berber fire at a small bird; so that they cannot have been all
destroyed, as is the case in certain parts of Europe, by the
efforts of the &ldquo;Sontags Jaeger&rdquo; and his twenty-five
mark gun.&nbsp; Curious idea that known as &ldquo;sport,&rdquo;
and perhaps liable, as much as anything, for the degradation of
mankind.&nbsp; Witness the Roman show of gladiators, the Spanish
bull fight, and the English pheasant butchery, where keepers
wring the necks of dozens of tame birds to swell the bag which
has to figure in the newspapers, so that the astonished public
recollect Lord A. or Mr. B. is still alive.</p>
<p>One thing is certain in Morocco, and that is, that the
domestic animals and man understand one another better than they
do in any other country I have seen.&nbsp; It may be that it is
because in the East the animals, now become so terribly
mechanical in Europe, were first domesticated.&nbsp; It may be
that the peaceful life gives time for men and animals to make
each other out.&nbsp; It may be that the monstrous cart horses,
greyhound-like thoroughbreds, ridiculously cropped and docked
hunters, and capitalistic looking carriage horses, with the whole
Noah&rsquo;s Ark of beef producing, milk secreting, wool growing
missing link between the animal creation and the machine world,
which we see in the fat &ldquo;streaky bacon&rdquo; pigs,
disgusting short horns, and improved sheep with backs like boxes,
feel their degradation, and hate us for imposing it upon them and
their race.&nbsp; No one can say <a name="page188"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 188</span>it is because the intellect of biped
and of quadruped is nearer in degree than it is in Europe, for
between the Arab tribesmen and the English or Scottish
countrymen, the balance certainly is not in favour of the
northerner, if abstract power of mind apart from education is to
be the test.&nbsp; What makes a flock of sheep follow an Arab,
and have to be driven by a European, I do not know.&nbsp; Why, if
an Arab buys a kid, in a few days it follows him about, I cannot
tell, but there is nothing commoner than to see Arabs walking on
the roads with curly black-woolled lambs and goats walking along
beside them, as only dogs, of all the animals, will do with
us.</p>
<p>Curiously enough, in South America, where animals of every
kind are much more plentiful than in the East, they are not on
the same familiar terms with man.</p>
<p>Who ever saw a lamb follow a Gaucho, Texan, Mexican, or any
man of any of the countries where sheep abound in millions, such
as Australia or New Zealand?&nbsp; I do not say that in Morocco
animals are greatly better treated than with us, though on the
whole I think perhaps the scale inclines against ourselves, but
still there is community of feeling which I have never seen in
any other land.&nbsp; Sometimes this same community makes the
tragedy of animal life even more hard to understand, as when a
man is followed by a lamb or kid up to the butcher, and stands
and sees the thing which followed him so happily have its throat
cut before his face, sees its eyes glaze, and its hot blood pour
out upon the sand, pockets his half-dollar, and walks serenely
home, after a pious exclamation about &ldquo;One God&rdquo;; as
if God, either in one or three, could possibly be pleased to see
one of his own created creatures so betray another only because
it walked upon four legs.&nbsp; However, let &ldquo;the
One&rdquo; (El Uahed) be pleased or not, no section of his clergy
throughout Europe have said one word in favour of <a
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>good
treatment of their brother animals.&nbsp; Popes and Archbishops
of Canterbury, of Paris, York, Toledo, and the rest, are dumber
than dumb dogs, fearing to offend, fearing, it may be, that the
animals have souls, or daring not to speak for fear of the
stronger brethren; for when did priest, tub-thumper, bishop,
Pope, or minister of any sect, take thought about the feelings of
the brethren who are weak?</p>
<p>My scabby-headed patient turned up towards evening, and sat
expectant in the door of the tent.&nbsp; After some thought, I
told him to rise exactly one hour before the Feyzer, and get
water from a stream (not from a well on any account), then put it
in a vessel and pray exactly as the Muezzin called to prayer,
then to walk backwards round an olive tree three times; every
third day for twice nine days, to avoid all food cooked with
Argan oil; finally, to wash his head well every day with soap,
then to rub in butter mixed with sulphur, and then, if God so
willed it, he would be well.&nbsp; A Seidlitz powder which he
drank at once, and said there was &ldquo;a spirit in the
water,&rdquo; <a name="citation189"></a><a href="#footnote189"
class="citation">[189]</a> and nine Beecham&rsquo;s Pills to be
taken alternately upon the third, the seventh, and the ninth day
till they were finished, sent him away rejoicing, and laid my
fame for ever as a first-class &ldquo;tabib.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We now began to think how far our messenger had got, and were
discussing how great the astonishment of the few Europeans in
Morocco city would be on hearing of our fate, when the tent door
was lifted and our messenger walked in, and silently laid the
packet and the two dollars at my feet.&nbsp; Had a volcano opened
upon the neighbouring hill I could not have been more surprised,
and for a moment no one spoke, so much had we counted on the
letters being well upon their way.</p>
<p><a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>Swani
first broke the silence with a string of imprecations on the
unlucky messenger&rsquo;s female relations whom he defiled, gave
up to Kaffirs, compared to hens, cows, goats, and finished up by
telling the poor man he evidently was born of a family the women
of which were shameless, veilless, and as hideous in their
persons as their characters were vile.&nbsp; The poor man sat
quite patiently, and then replied it was no use to curse him, his
heart had failed, and that he feared if he were found out the
Kaid would kill him, burn his house, and throw his children into
prison to rot and die.&nbsp; Though I was much annoyed, I was
sorry for him, as one is always sorry for all those whose hearts
fail at the wrong minute, and I was touched that he had brought
me the two dollars back.&nbsp; Most likely in his life he had
never seen himself at the head of so much capital, and it would
have been easy for him to throw away the packet and not
return.&nbsp; Therefore I handed him a dollar, and remarked,
those who have families should not engage in enterprises such as
these; God loves stout-hearted men, but perhaps loves quite as
much fathers who love their children, but, children or no
children, we are all in his hand.&nbsp; This, though they had
heard it a million times, seemed to console all present, and the
messenger slunk from the tent ashamed, but happy, having been
paid on a scale he thought was lavish for a mere twenty-two
hours&rsquo; walk. <a name="citation190"></a><a
href="#footnote190" class="citation">[190]</a>&nbsp; Certainly
when he went we were cast down, for it appeared impossible to get
a letter safely conveyed, so we agreed next morning to saddle up
our animals and see if the Kaid would allow us to return, <a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>thinking,
perhaps, his injunctions only lay upon the road towards the
Sus.&nbsp; This settled, Lutaif and I walked long backwards and
forwards on the Maidan, in the clear moonlight, and heard the
long-drawn, quavering notes of a wild song like a
Malague&ntilde;a rise in the still night air, wayward and strange
in interval, sung in a high falsetto voice, and yet enthralling
and penetrating to the marrow of the bones; once heard, haunting
one&rsquo;s memory for ever afterwards, and still almost
impossible to catch; but it recalls Kintafi to me as I write,
just as the scent of fresh-cut oranges brings me back to
Paraguay, so that perhaps perfumes and sounds are after all the
most stable of the illusions amongst which we live.</p>
<h2><a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
192</span>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Just</span> about daylight we began to
load our beasts, looking anxiously the while to see if any notice
of our proceedings was taken from the castle walls.&nbsp; No one
stirred, and hungry, without provisions for the road, our animals
half-starved but lightly laden&mdash;for the greatest weight we
had in coming had been food and barley&mdash;we prepared to
start.</p>
<p>In the other tents the people made no sign, it was so early
that neither the slaves were in the fields, nor yet the prisoners
come up out of their living tomb, and still I thought it would be
prudent before leaving to send Mohammed-el-Hosein to say that we
were going, for to escape unseen was quite impossible, and even
if we had slipped off unseen, once the alarm was given we should
have been overtaken and brought back at once.&nbsp; We had not
long to wait; Mohammed-el-Hosein soon came back crestfallen, the
postern door was swung wide open and the Chamberlain emerged,
followed by several tribesmen all ostentatiously carrying long
guns.&nbsp; Although it was so early he was dressed, as at all
times, in most spotless clothes, and walked across the Maidan
with as near an approach to haste as I had ever seen him
make.&nbsp; Arrived at where we stood, he saluted us quite
ceremoniously, and asked where we were going, to which I
answered, &ldquo;Back to Mogador.&rdquo;&nbsp; On this he said,
&ldquo;The Kaid bids me to tell you not to go to-day as he could
never think of letting Europeans go without an audience, but most
unfortunately his wound <a name="page193"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 193</span>pains him this morning, and besides
that, now you are known as Christians, he would not let you
wander through the hill passes without an escort, therefore he
bids me tell you to unload and wait.&rdquo;&nbsp; For a moment I
thought, &ldquo;If we go on he will not dare to stop us,&rdquo;
and taking my bridle in my hand, prepared to mount, when the
armed followers drew near, handling their guns, as if to shoot a
Christian would have been great sport.</p>
<p>The Chamberlain said a few words in Shillah, which having been
interpreted, said if we insisted upon going he must see his
master&rsquo;s orders carried out.&nbsp; Seeing that the Kaid was
resolved we should not go, I gave my horse to Swani and went into
the tent.&nbsp; The Chamberlain came after me, and standing in
the door told me most civilly that he had done what he was told
to do; as he had done it in the most well-bred way, with every
consideration for my feelings and without a trace of swagger, I
thought the moment had arrived to talk and understand each other
if we could.&nbsp; The Chamberlain, Sidi <a
name="citation193"></a><a href="#footnote193"
class="citation">[193]</a> Mohammed, was a well-favoured,
&ldquo;coffee and skim-milk&rdquo; coloured man; portly, of
course, as became his office, honest as officers of great men go,
well-dressed and courteous; in fact, a sort of Eastern Malvolio,
with the addition of some sense.</p>
<p>I laid before him my two chief complaints, which I said I had
no wish to bother him about, but that it seemed the best thing I
could do was to marry a maiden or two belonging to the tribe and
set up house, as there seemed little chance of ever moving from
the place.&nbsp; However, in the meantime, should <a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>the Kaid
consent to let us go, I did not want to walk back to the coast,
and my horse and the other animals were growing weaker every day
for want of food.&nbsp; Without preamble, therefore, I promised
Sidi Mohammed a handsome present when I went if he would see that
the man who kept the corn gave a sufficient quantity every day
and did not sell it or keep it back as he had done for the past
week.&nbsp; Sidi Mohammed expressed astonishment at such
behaviour, and perhaps felt it, as no doubt the Kaid had ordered
our horses to be fed, and promised to see about the matter
instantly and put things right.</p>
<p>My next complaint was that there were five of us all in one
small tent, and that such crowding was neither comfortable nor
seemly, either for a Christian &ldquo;caballer&rdquo; or for a
Moorish gentleman, which rank my clothes and following entitled
me to take.&nbsp; The promise of the present smoothed the way,
and Sidi Mohammed said he would take upon himself to give
permission to pitch another tent.&nbsp; This being done, and the
men, the saddles, harness, and saddle-cloths transferred to a
smaller tent, we had our own swept out and aired; a new drain cut
to carry off the water, and stones arranged (which looked exactly
like an Arab grave), to place our rugs upon, and keep them off
the damp.&nbsp; For the first time for a week Lutaif and I were
comfortable, washed in a tin basin, changed our clothes, and
sitting in the sun at the open door of the tent drank tea and
smoked, planning the while to get another man to take the letters
which the faithless or heartless messenger had brought back the
night before.&nbsp; Swani and Mohammed-el-Hosein went to the
river and washed their clothes, and even Ali, who had nothing
except what he wore, borrowed an old Djelab and, standing in the
river, stamped upon his rags.</p>
<p>Our friend the Persian came and sat with us, <a
name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>condoling
on our having been prevented starting, but saying I had taken the
right way with Si-Mohammed, and that he was glad we had got
another tent.</p>
<p>As we sat talking, a Jew pedlar arrived bringing two laden
mules.&nbsp; The Persian said he might by chance have some
tobacco, and being out of it I sent and asked the Jew to come and
talk.&nbsp; He came, and thinking I was a Moor began to offer all
his goods, henna, and looking-glasses, needles and cotton,
scissors from Germany, knives made in Spain, and cotton cloths
(well-sized) from Manchester.&nbsp; I let him talk, but when he
saw that every now and then I missed some words and had to ask an
explanation from Lutaif, who answered me in English, he began to
stare, and at last said in stumbling Spanish, &ldquo;Are you not
a Moor?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I replied.&nbsp; He said,
&ldquo;What, then, you cannot be a Jew?&rdquo;&nbsp; On hearing
that I was a Christian, <a name="citation195a"></a><a
href="#footnote195a" class="citation">[195a]</a> his amazement
knew no bounds.&nbsp; &ldquo;Christian,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;and dressed like a Moor, camped in the middle of the
Atlas, how ever came you here?&rdquo;&nbsp; When I informed him I
had passed as a Sherif, he roared with laughter, and said he
would have given all his mules&rsquo; load to see the people come
and kiss my clothes.</p>
<p>It seemed he lived in Agadhir-Ighir, <a
name="citation195b"></a><a href="#footnote195b"
class="citation">[195b]</a> and traded through the Atlas, as he
informed me many of the poorer Jews do, selling their goods, and
buying wool and goat-skins to take back.&nbsp; He had tobacco
from Algeria of a villainous quality, strong, black and common,
and done up in gaudy-coloured packets, adorned, one with a
picture of a lady dancing &ldquo;le chahut,&rdquo; another of
apocryphal-looking Arabs resting in an Oasis; the third displayed
a little French soldier running his bayonet through a picture of
<a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>Bismarck, and underneath the legend, in Italian,
&ldquo;Furia Francese,&rdquo; and to make all sure the Regie
mark.&nbsp; I bought all three, which sold him out, and all my
men were gratified with about half-a-pound apiece.&nbsp; They
said it was the best tobacco they had ever smoked, but I think
that tobacco was to them as it was to a Scotch gamekeeper to whom
I gave, when a boy fresh from school, a packet of Honey Dew which
I had bought in London, and who said upon my asking him if it was
good, &ldquo;Ye ken, Sir, if she burns she is good tobacco, and
if she willna burn, then she&rsquo;s nae good.&rdquo;&nbsp; The
Persian too participated in the tobacco, being reduced to smoking
Kief. <a name="citation196"></a><a href="#footnote196"
class="citation">[196]</a>&nbsp; Under the influence of the
Algerian tobacco, which, to make himself intelligible to me, he
characterised as being &ldquo;bon besaf,&rdquo; he got back to
his wanderings up and down the world.</p>
<p>Ifrikia, as he called Africa, he thought the most savage and
abominable portion of the earth.&nbsp; Even the Kurds, whom he
knew well, he thought were not so fierce as were the Arabs of the
Wad-Nun.&nbsp; The poor man, an ardent believer in Mohammedanism,
though not a bigot, and at times gaining his livelihood by
discoursing on Mohammed and the Koran, whilst travelling in
Wad-Nun upon the road to Timbuctoo, which as he said he did not
reach, there being &ldquo;too much powder on the road,&rdquo; was
frequently in peril of his life, being taken for an unbeliever,
being himself a Sufi, and the Moors all members of the sect into
which orthodox Mohammedans are grouped.&nbsp; The <a
name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>poor old
Ajemi <a name="citation197"></a><a href="#footnote197"
class="citation">[197]</a> it appeared on one occasion was
surrounded by a band of Arabs who held their daggers to his
throat, and put their guns up to his head until he, losing
patience, knelt upon the sand, said &ldquo;Bismillah, kill me in
God&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; reciting the confession of his faith in
a loud voice.&nbsp; However, Allah, he said, had spared him, for
after taking all his money, and almost all his clothes, the Arabs
had let him go, and cautioned him to walk with God and not return
to the Wad-Nun again.&nbsp; This he was confident he would not
do, preferring even Franguestan and its peculiar ways to the
companionship of such evil-begotten men as those.&nbsp; I like to
think of him, friendless and all alone, kneeling upon the sand,
surrounded by a crowd of horsemen, ready, although not wishing,
to be killed, and wonder if he thought about the irony of things,
that he, an ardent votary of his religion, was to be put to death
for heresy.&nbsp; At times when thinking upon other
people&rsquo;s travels (always so much more interesting than any
of my own), it comes before me how that, in desert places,
mountain passes and the like, so many men must have been killed,
and met their fate heroically, the situation so to speak thrown
away, with no one there to see, record, to write about it, as if
the poor, forlorn and wasted heroes were no more worth a thought
than the fat man of business who snorts his life out on a
feather-bed between a medicine bottle and a mumbling
priest.&nbsp; So the old Persian left us to make his preparations
for an early start next day, hoping to reach a saint&rsquo;s tomb
of great sanctity on the hill path which leads from Kintafi to
Tamasluocht, but is only to be passed on foot.&nbsp; He said he
was tired of this wild part of Africa, and would <a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>make his
way to Magador, thence to Tangier, return to Persia and push on
to China, which he hoped to visit ere he died.&nbsp; Considering
that he had little money, for I expect the twenty dollars of the
Kaid were for the most part quite apocryphal, and that the
journey, made as he would make it, would probably take years, he
did not seem too excited, or as much so as a man who thinks his
things have been put into the wrong luggage van at Charing
Cross.</p>
<p>People who write about the progress of the world, the wealth
of nations, of economic laws, and subjects of that kind,
requiring rather stronger imaginative powers than reason, logic,
or than common-sense, are apt to take it as a well-established
fact that before railways were invented people, especially poor
people, travelled but little, and generally never moved far from
the places where they were born.&nbsp; This may have been so in
the last two hundred years, although I doubt it, but certainly
during the Middle Ages they must have travelled much.&nbsp;
Leaving the pilgrimages out of account (and they, of course,
brought every European nation into contact), I take it that many
roved about, as they still do in Eastern lands.&nbsp; People, no
doubt, had no facilities for travelling for mere
amusement&rsquo;s sake; but if we read any old book of travels,
how often does the writer meet a countryman, a student, minstrel,
soldier, or wandering artisan in countries far away.</p>
<p>So, when the Persian went, we strolled out for a walk,
followed the river for a mile or two, and found it full of fish;
but the whole time we sojourned at Kintafi we saw no one fishing
either with rod or net.&nbsp; The people whom we met were all
well armed; and when they met us, kissed our clothes, taking us
for Arabs of rank upon a visit to the Kaid.</p>
<p>It always pleased me to see two Arabs or two Berbers meet,
embrace each other, kiss each other&rsquo;s <a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>shoulder,
ask respectively, How is your house? (&ldquo;Darde-alic&rdquo;),
for to enquire after the health of even a brother&rsquo;s wife
would be indecent; and then, the ceremony over, sit down to talk
and strive with might and main to cheat each other, after the
fashion in which Englishmen proceed in the same case.</p>
<p>Seated beneath a cliff, our feet just dangling in the stream
to cool, smoking the vile Algerian tobacco, Lutaif began to tell
me of his life in Syria, described his father&rsquo;s house, a
great, gaunt place with a long chamber in the middle, given up to
winding silk; spoke of the undying enmity between the Turk, the
Druse, the Maronite, and the Old Catholics, of which sect he was
a member; leaving on my mind the feeling that the Lebanon for a
residence must be as undesirable as was Scotland in the old
wicked days, when they burnt witches, and the narrow-minded
clergy made the land a hell.&nbsp; One thing particularly struck
me when he said, upon a walk, if we had been in Syria, dressed as
we were in clothes which marked us for Mohammedans, and had we
met four or five Christians, they would have either insulted or
attacked us; and, of course, the same held good for Christians
who on a walk met Turks.&nbsp; Remembering this happy state of
things, and having from his youth looked upon every Mohammedan as
a sworn enemy, when he first came to Morocco, knowing the people
were fanatical Mohammedans, he passed his life in dread.&nbsp;
Once in Tangier, not thinking what he did, or of the peril that
he naturally incurred, he took a country walk.&nbsp; He started
from the town dressed as a European, carrying a silver-headed
stick, and several oranges in a brown paper bag to eat upon the
way.&nbsp; After a mile or two, he took an orange out of his bag
and, sitting down, was just about to eat when to his horror, on
the sandy road, what did he see but five or six well-armed young
men come, as he said, dancing like <a name="page200"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 200</span>devils up the road and brandishing
their knives.&nbsp; He called upon his God and closed his eyes,
being quite sure that his last hour was come.&nbsp; Then to his
great surprise the men stopped dancing, sheathed their knives and
after saluting him respectfully sat down, several yards away,
without a word.&nbsp; At last one asked him humbly for an orange,
and Lutaif took the whole bag and was about to entreat them to
take all his oranges, his clothes, his money, everything, but to
spare his life.&nbsp; To his amazement, the man took an orange
from the bag, divided it into five portions, one of which he
handed to each of the young men, and handed back the bag.&nbsp;
The exiguous portions of the orange discussed, the spokesman
asked him not to point the silver-headed stick their way, for it
appeared they had got into their minds it was some kind of gun,
which, if Lutaif discharged it, would destroy them all.&nbsp; He
promised faithfully, and the wayfarers went upon their way,
leaving Lutaif as frightened as themselves.&nbsp; No doubt when
first he saw them they were exercising, skipping about like
fawns, in the sheer joy of life, but as they came upon him
suddenly, their sandalled feet making no noise upon the sandy
road, for a Syrian the vision must have been horrible enough.</p>
<p>When he wrote home and told his friends what had occurred to
him, and how a Christian was regarded (near Tangier) with respect
and awe, the answer that he got was curious.&nbsp; Of course they
thought he was telling lies, but his best friend admonished him
it was bad taste to jest about Mohammedans; for, though no doubt
they were bad neighbours, no one in Syria could call them
cowards.&nbsp; In fact, the friend appeared to me to be like
every Eastern Christian I have met, quick to run down the Turks,
to fight with them, hating them bitterly at home; but yet if a
stranger slighted them abroad, quick to resent the slight, say <a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>they were
brave, and that they erred through wicked counsellors and not
from lack of heart.</p>
<p>All the above he told me, and plenty more, with the inimitable
charm that Easterns have in storytelling, compared to which even
Guy de Maupassant, Chaucer, Boccaccio, Balzac, or Fielding fall
immeasurably behind.&nbsp; The doubtful author of the Celestina
<a name="citation201"></a><a href="#footnote201"
class="citation">[201]</a> and Cervantes, perhaps, come nearer;
but then they, being Spaniards, were more nearly in communion
with the East.</p>
<p>As we returned, tired and half hoping that there might be
news, we learned a &ldquo;rekass&rdquo; had just arrived bringing
despatches from the Sultan to the Kaid.&nbsp; Though we knew well
there had not been time for the Kaid to get an answer to the
letter he had sent about ourselves, yet outside news was
valuable, and, in fact, had I chanced to come upon a copy of the
Rock, I think I could have read it, advertisements and all.&nbsp;
In half an hour or so the &ldquo;rekass&rdquo; strolled past our
tent, and I invited him to come and have some tea.&nbsp; Out of
respect he sat outside the tent, saluted us, and remained waiting
to be interrogated.&nbsp; He was a tall, lean, teak-complexioned
man, in face resembling a Maori god stuck up outside a Pah;
vacant and glassy eyed and at first sight a kieffi, that is a
kief smoker, thick lipped and with uncertain speech as if the
tongue was (like the tongues of Bourbons) too large for his
mouth, also a symptom of too much kief smoking; legs like a
bronco&rsquo;s from the Bad Lands, a mule&rsquo;s, or a
bagual&rsquo;s from the stony deserts of Patagonia; feet rather
large, with the toes so flexible that the whole member seemed to
quiver as he walked.&nbsp; For clothes he had a single white
garment like a <a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>nightshirt (long freed from all the tyranny of soap),
hanging down almost to the ankles, girt round the waist with a
string of camel&rsquo;s hair.&nbsp; He went bare-headed and had a
cord of camel&rsquo;s hair bound round his temples, with a long
lock, at least eight inches long, hanging from the top of his
bare shaven head beside his ear.&nbsp; Though he had walked
incessantly for the last seven days, sleeping an hour or two with
a piece of burning match tied to his toe to wake him as it burned
away, he strolled about, or sitting drank his tea, taking a cup
now and again, which Ali or Swani passed to him out of the
tent.&nbsp; He said as long as he had kief he never wanted food,
but munched a bit of bread occasionally, drank at every stream,
and trotted on day after day, just like a camel, for, as he told
us, he was born to run.&nbsp; Withal no fool, and pious, praying
now and then whenever he passed a saint&rsquo;s tomb and felt
wearied with the way.&nbsp; Just such a man as you may see
amongst the cholos of the sierras of Peru, with the difference
that the cholo takes coca instead of kief, and is in general a
short, squat, ugly fellow, whereas our kieffi stood over six feet
high, straight as a pikestaff, and was intelligent after his
fashion, could read and write, and no doubt knew as much theology
as was required from a right-thinking man.</p>
<p>For impedimenta he had a little bag in which he kept his kief,
his matches, pipe, and the small store of money which it was
possible he had.&nbsp; In one hand he carried a stout
quarter-staff full five feet long, which all
&ldquo;rekasses&rdquo; use to walk with, try the depth of water
in crossing streams, defend themselves, and ease their backs by
passing it behind them through their two arms, and resting on it
as they trot along.</p>
<p>His news was brief but bloody.&nbsp; &ldquo;Our Lord the
Sultan is camped in Tedla. <a name="citation202"></a><a
href="#footnote202" class="citation">[202]</a>&nbsp; He is indeed
a king, <a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
203</span>fifty-one heads cut off, two tribes quite eaten up,
three hundred of the Kaffirs wounded!&nbsp; O what a joy it was
to see the &lsquo;maquina,&rsquo; the Christian devil gun, which
fires all day, play on the enemies of our Lord the king.&nbsp;
Praise be to Allah who alone giveth victory.&rdquo;&nbsp; Which
being interpreted meant that the Sultan had gone under pretence
of peace to Tedla; had by the advice of the Grand Vizier Ba Ahmed
attacked them; butchered as many as he could, and probably sent a
few hundred to die in gaol.&nbsp; The selfsame fate overtook the
Rahamna tribe close to Morocco city.&nbsp; They fought a year
with varying success, but at the last were decimated, butchered
in hundreds, and their power destroyed.</p>
<p>The Grand Vizier Ba Ahmed, if all reports be true, is a bad
counsellor for the young Sultan, Mulai Abdul Assiz.&nbsp; But be
this as it may&mdash;for some who know the country say that the
Grand Vizier, being a Moor, knows how to rule his
countrymen&mdash;Sidi Ahmed ben Musa, usually called Ba Ahmed
(Father Ahmed), is an ambitious and most powerful man, holding
the Sultan in a sort of tutelage, and piling up a fortune by his
exactions, which report says he has invested in safe securities
abroad.</p>
<p>The father of the Sultan, Mulai el Hassan, who died or was
poisoned some four years ago, was a remarkable personality, and
perhaps one of the last Oriental potentates of the old
school.&nbsp; Standing about six feet three inches in his
slippers, he was dark in face, having, though a descendant of
Mohammed, some negro blood; a perfect horseman, shot, and skilled
in swordsmanship; though educated in all the learning of the
Moors, he yet was tolerant of Christians, kind to Jews, and much
more liberal in regard to new ideas than is his son, that is to
say, if it is not Ba Ahmed who directs his policy.&nbsp; Mulai el
Hassan was what is called a &ldquo;riding Sultan,&rdquo; that is
a <a name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
204</span>warrior, always on horseback, and passing all his life
either in journeys between his various capitals, or on long
expeditions to reduce refractory tribes.&nbsp; His fine white
horse has been described by almost every embassy for the past ten
years that went to Fez, for from his back the Sultan used to
receive ambassadors, who bound in their hats, hosen, coats,
swords, tight boots, and dignity, and forced to stand in a hot
sun, on foot, must have presented a very lamentable sight.</p>
<p>On the white horse&rsquo;s back the Sultan almost died, for
one who saw him shortly before his death was standing in a street
in the outskirts of Marakesh when the Sultan passed, having been
sixteen hours on horseback in the rain, and looking like a
corpse.&nbsp; Next day he died so suddenly that some thought he
had been poisoned, but others think worn out with care and
trouble, long journeys, and all the burden of a ruler&rsquo;s
life.&nbsp; All those who knew him say that his manners were most
courteous, kind, and dignified, and that through all his life
none of his servants ever heard him raise his voice, even in
battle or when he ordered some unlucky man to death, above its
ordinary pitch.</p>
<p>His clothes were spotless white; but made in the fashion of
those worn by an ordinary tribesman, only of finer stuff.&nbsp;
Colours he never wore, or jewellery, except a silver ring with a
large diamond, and which when once an individual, whose name I
forbear to mention, asked him for it for a keepsake, he half drew
off (for usually he gave all that was asked for); but replaced
and said with a quiet smile, &ldquo;No, I will keep it, but you
can have its value in money if you choose.&rdquo;&nbsp; His
clothes he never wore more than a day, and then his servants
claimed them as perquisites; so that his wardrobe must have been
pretty extensive even for a king.&nbsp; Upon a journey he carried
almost all he had, packed upon camels, and, being troubled with
insomnia at times, would say, &ldquo;Bring me the <a
name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>telescope
the Belgian Minister gave me ten years ago,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the
watch the Queen of England sent me,&rdquo; and the unlucky man to
whom he spoke had to produce the thing, if he unpacked a hundred
camels in the search.</p>
<p>The taxes he used to collect in person with an army, so that
his camp was like a town of canvas, and yet the order of his own
tents so great and his men so skilled in pitching them, that at a
halt they used to rise like magic from the ground.</p>
<p>Wives, and that sort of thing, he had about three hundred, and
was much addicted to their company, and some of them accompanied
him on all the journeys which he made.&nbsp; His son, the present
Sultan, was born of a Circassian, white, and report said
beautiful and educated; but she transmitted little beauty and
less education to her son, who is a rather heavy youth of about
twenty, not well instructed, and completely in the hands of his
Vizier, Ba Ahmed, who, by exactions, cruelties, and bloodshed,
has made his master&rsquo;s name detested all through the
land.&nbsp; Still a strong man, and no doubt in such countries as
Morocco, when a Sultan dies a strong man is required, for the
tribes usually rise in rebellion, kill their Kaids, burn down
their castles, and a recognised period of anarchy takes place,
known as El Siba by the natives, and of which they all take full
advantage.</p>
<p>That the Vizier was a man of readiness and resource is shown
by the way he foiled the expedition of the yacht
<i>Tourmaline</i>, <a name="citation205"></a><a
href="#footnote205" class="citation">[205]</a> by means of which
a syndicate in London endeavoured to procure a footing in the
Sus.&nbsp; Thinking the kieffi would be an excellent man to take
our letters, we sounded him, but in a moment he became
mysterious, said he must sleep, would think about it, and though
we often saw him <a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
206</span>subsequently strolling about, he never visited our tent
again.</p>
<p>After the kieffi went, the Persian came to say good-bye, and
sat long talking about Montenegro, where the people are all
brave, and to his astonishment, for they are Franks, the women
virtuous.&nbsp; He tells us that their enmity with the Arnauts is
constant, and this he illustrated by linking his two forefingers
to indicate a fight.&nbsp; &ldquo;Brave men,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;who, when they draw the sword, never go back, and a fine
country, but lacking the true faith.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then came the
leave-taking, and I presented him with a dollar, which he has
magnified in talking of it to at least twenty, and he, after a
few well-chosen, dignified sentences of thanks, pressed his open
palm against my hand, and then pressed it upon his heart, saying
again, &ldquo;Mesquin, may you have patience, and may Allah not
open to you the Sultan&rsquo;s gate!&rdquo;&nbsp; And so he took
the road, shouldering his sack of &ldquo;possibles,&rdquo; and in
his hand a staff, and carrying, God knows why, a wooden board,
and in a little faded away on the hill track, out of my sight and
life.&nbsp; Vaya con Dios, I never knew his name, for he was not
a man given to descending to particulars of such a kind, and it
is rank ill manners to ask an Oriental what his name is, the
fiction being that he is so well known, to ask would be
impertinent.&nbsp; It may be that he may cast up some day across
my path, for he is always on the march; but if he does not, in
many an Eastern khan and fondak men will know of me, not by my
name, for that he never knew, but as the Frankish stranger whom
he met a prisoner in the Atlas, and who gave him gold and more
gold, so that he had to buy a sack to carry it away.&nbsp; And at
the saints&rsquo; tombs, and in mosques, there he will pray for
me (at least he said so), and I shall know that what he says will
not be said in vain, for has not Sidna Mohammed himself <a
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>averred
that &ldquo;the prayers of a stranger are always heard by
God.&rdquo; <a name="citation207"></a><a href="#footnote207"
class="citation">[207]</a></p>
<p>So, sadly, as if we had lost one we had known from youth,
Lutaif and I wandered along the river; and by a stony beach,
under some oleander bushes, came on a little tea-party, all
seated on the ground.&nbsp; A little pleases Arabs, who in a
measure are like children, easily pleased, and passing easily
from good temper into rage, and nothing gives them greater
satisfaction than when a stranger comes and joins their pleasure
or their meals.&nbsp; So we advanced, and found they were three
Sherifs from Taseruelt; Sherifs, but practically beggars, though
white men of pure Arab blood and race.&nbsp; One was a little
thin and wizened man, with hardly any beard, his clothes quite
clean, but washed into holes by frequent soaping and thumping
against the stones of streams.&nbsp; Quick, taciturn, and most
intelligent, a hunter and, I think, an acrobat, and wearing round
his head a yellow cloth gun-case twisted like a turban, which,
with his meagre features and pale face, gave him an air as of a
dwarf ghost or spectre, as he sat smoking kief.&nbsp; The other
two were fine young men, but poorly dressed, and perhaps got
their living by praying, or by writing charms, for all could read
and write, and neither of the three seemed ever to have done any
of that same honest toil which so much ennobles man.&nbsp; Placed
on the sand before them stood a small brass tray, and on it three
small glass tumblers and a tin teapot of the conical pattern
which Germany supplies.&nbsp; Dried figs and walnuts were on
another tray, and all were smoking kief.&nbsp; Close to them, on
a little patch of grass, <a name="page208"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 208</span>fed a black curly lamb, which I
supposed they had reared and brought with them from Taseruelt;
but they assured me it was given to them only two days ago, and
now followed them like a dog.&nbsp; I asked if they intended to
dispose of it, and they said no, they would teach it to do
tricks, and gain much money by its antics, and as we spoke it
walked up to the tray, took up a fig, smelt at it, but thought it
unfit to eat, and then, after skipping about a bit, came back and
went to sleep with its head resting upon its special
owner&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<p>We squatted down beside the three Sherifs and became friends
at once, drank endless cups of tea as sweet as syrup, ate figs
and walnuts, talked of Europe and of Taseruelt, and, I think,
never in my life did I enjoy an afternoon so thoroughly.&nbsp;
They asked no questions, thinking it apparently not strange we
should be there dressed as Mohammedans, and I almost unable to
speak Arabic, as if, for example, a Chinese dressed as an English
country gentleman should stumble in upon a gang of haymakers in
Rutlandshire, and sit down and drink beer.&nbsp; Much did they
tell of the Wad Nun, and of the desert horses, known as
&ldquo;wind drinkers,&rdquo; on which men hunt the ostrich,
feeding them well on dates and camel&rsquo;s milk, and flying
through the sands after the ostriches in the same manner that the
Pehuelches hunt their ostriches in Patagonia, save that the Arabs
throw a club instead of the ostrich &ldquo;bolas&rdquo; which the
Pehuelches use.&nbsp; In both countries the tactics are the same,
the huntsmen spreading out like a fan, striving to join their
ranks and get the birds into a circle, or to drive them into a
marsh, edge of a stream, or some place out of which they cannot
run.</p>
<p>The little dwarf Sherif got up and showed me how an ostrich
ran, waving his arms and craning out his neck in a way which
would have made his fortune on <a name="page209"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 209</span>the stage.&nbsp; It then appeared he
had been a moufflon hunter, and he told how they can jump down
precipices alighting on their horns, how shy they are; and here
he worked his nose about to show the way they snuffed the wind
when danger was about, so that he looked more like a moufflon
than the very beast itself.&nbsp; His friends smiled gravely, and
said Allah had given their comrade excellent gifts, and one was
to be able to imitate all beasts, and another was to run all day
and never feel fatigue.</p>
<p>On hearing this I mentally resolved he should run to Morocco
city with our letters, starting that very night; but mentioned
nothing of my purpose, intending to leave Swani to arrange it by
himself.&nbsp; We thanked our entertainers, gave them some of our
Algerian tobacco, which they prized highly, and the deputation
then withdrew.&nbsp; As I looked back they had not moved, but the
black curly lamb had gone back to the grass, and they, beneath
the oleanders, seated on the stones, still sat smoking happily,
before their little tray, as if the world belonged to them, as
after all it did.</p>
<p>Just before nightfall Swani brought the small Sherif
ostensibly for medicine to our tent.&nbsp; When asked to carry
letters he said yes, that he was poor and wanted to buy clothes
for winter, and would go at once, and his companions and the lamb
could meet him somewhere near the coast.&nbsp; I asked if he
could run, and he replied &ldquo;like an Oudad,&rdquo; <a
name="citation209"></a><a href="#footnote209"
class="citation">[209]</a> and by that name we knew him ever
since.&nbsp; Five dollars was our bargain, two in the hand and
three upon arriving at the missionary&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; He
asked no questions save the position of the missionary&rsquo;s
house, took the two dollars and the packet and a note asking the
missionary to pay him three dollars when the letters came to
hand, thanked us, and said &ldquo;Your letters shall
arrive,&rdquo; <a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
210</span>walked quickly off, and disappeared into the
night.&nbsp; On the evening of the third day from that on which
he went, a dusty little man knocked at the missionary&rsquo;s
door more than a hundred miles away, handed a packet in, and
waited whilst the note he brought was read, got his three dollars
and an extra one for speed, and when the missionary, who went for
a moment into his house to read the letters returned to question
him, he was already gone.&nbsp; So the Oudad, after the Persian
flashed across my path, or I intruded upon theirs, we talked,
made friends, separated, and shall never meet again; but the
impression that they made was much more vivid than that caused by
worthy friends whom one meets every day and differentiates but by
the checks upon their shooting jackets.</p>
<p>Determining to leave no stone untried, Lutaif, who fancied
himself on his epistolary style, said he would write a letter to
the Kaid to ask for an interview.&nbsp; About an hour he spent
upon the task, lying upon his stomach in the tent, and writing on
a large flimsy sheet of Spanish note-paper with a small pencil
end; but after so much trouble he produced a gem, crammed full of
compliments, in such high Arabic that he thought none but the
Taleb would decipher it, and written as beautifully clear as Arab
copper-plate:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the most happy and exemplary, the most fortunate and
honourable, the Kaid Si Taleb Mohammed el Kintafi.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May God&rsquo;s peace and blessing be upon you whilst
day lasts and time endures.&nbsp; Oh, Kaid, thou art the wielder
of the sword and pen.&nbsp; Fate and a love of travel have led us
to your happy and well-governed land, and you have generously
received and entertained us, extending to us all the hospitality
of your thrice blessed house.&nbsp; May God establish it for
ever, and may the hand of no man be ever higher than <a
name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 211</span>your
hand.&nbsp; But, mighty prince, we fear to trespass too long upon
your kindness, though we know your hand is never tired of
shedding blessings upon all.&nbsp; Therefore, we wish to see your
face and thank you for your hospitality, so that on our return on
talking of you we can say this was a man.&nbsp; May Allah bless
and keep you, and at the last may Sidna Mohammed welcome you upon
your entrance into Paradise.&nbsp; Deign, therefore, to accord an
hour to-morrow on which to speak with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This missive, read aloud, evoked great admiration both from
Swani and Mohammed el Hosein, and they declared it certainly
would have a good effect.&nbsp; So Swani, dressed in a clean
white burnous, which Lutaif had with him in his saddle-bags, and
with a pair of my new yellow slippers, went off, and with much
ceremony handed the letter to the keeper of the gate.&nbsp;
Knowing the respect the Moors attach to letters, and the
astonishment they show if any Christian can write their
characters, I thought perhaps the letter might bring an
interview; but thinking of the happy afternoon I had spent with
the simple fakirs upon the stony beach, did not care much,
knowing the happy hours that a man passes in his life are few,
and of more value than much gold or all the jewels of the
Apocalypse.</p>
<h2><a name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
212</span>CHAPTER IX.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Though</span> not so sanguine as Lutaif,
as to the emollient powers of his epistle, I was pleased to find
that for the first time, next morning, we received ample supplies
of food, baskets of grapes and oranges, and for the first time
people spoke to us without an air of breaking some command.</p>
<p>During the morning a miserable bundle of rags arrived and
stood before our tent, asking in broken Arabic if we were the
Christians, and on being answered in the affirmative broke out
into French.&nbsp; It appeared he was a French deserter from
Algeria, having deserted in Ain Sefra, <a
name="citation212"></a><a href="#footnote212"
class="citation">[212]</a> walked to Figig, and pretended to turn
Mohammedan, he came by Tafilet, and was about to make his way
down to the coast.&nbsp; This, as he said, was his itinerary, but
why he should have come round by Tafilet, he did not
explain.&nbsp; He certainly was not a personable man; a
weasel-faced, pale, and fair-haired Parisian &ldquo;voyou,&rdquo;
thin, active, and half-starved, foot-sore and weary, dressed in
rags, and speaking a jargon of bad Arabic, compared to which that
spoken by the Persian and myself became as the language of the
Khoreish, or the best literal Arabic which Cairo boasts.&nbsp; He
told us that he slept in the mosques, making the profession of
his faith if there was any doubt about him before going <a
name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>in; this
with a wink, and &ldquo;Sont-ils b&ecirc;tes, ces Arabes,
&agrave; la fin!&rdquo;&nbsp; After he had eaten and smoked, he
said that it was common in Algeria for soldiers to desert, adopt
the Arab dress, and make their way into Morocco; some reached the
coast, but many disappeared, murdered by the tribesmen or the
villagers upon the way.&nbsp; Withal a merry knave, relating how
he had served in a Spahi regiment during the war in Madagascar,
and that the Arab troopers, when the war broke out, talked of the
war with Madame Casba, <a name="citation213a"></a><a
href="#footnote213a" class="citation">[213a]</a> and thought she
was Sultana of some island, who was fighting with the
French.&nbsp; Although he had no arms or money, he did not seem
afraid, but trusted to arrive in Mogador or Saffi in a few
weeks&rsquo; time.&nbsp; We went to bathe and left him smoking
under a tree with Swani, talking a mixture of Arabic and French:
on our return in half an hour, thinking to see him still before
the tent, and make him tell us what he had seen in his long
tramp, we found that, without a word to anyone, he had slunk
mysteriously away.</p>
<p>Once in Morocco city I met three Englishmen dressed in the red
baize rags which form the uniform of the Sherifian troops.&nbsp;
Where they came from they did not say, but wanted money to buy
magia <a name="citation213b"></a><a href="#footnote213b"
class="citation">[213b]</a> and tobacco; I gave them something,
and on receiving it with not too laboured thanks, they too mixed
with the crowd in one of the bazaars and disappeared.</p>
<p>In the crowded Kaisariehs of the towns, and in the endless
processions of noiseless-footed people on the roads, nothing is
more surprising than the way in which odd characters come to the
surface for a moment <a name="page214"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 214</span>(like a fish rising), and then sink
back again into the depths from which they rose.</p>
<p>On mules and donkeys, on horseback and on foot, beggars, or
travelling well attended, Berbers and Arabs, Jews, Negroes,
Haratin, men from the Sahara, and from the mountains of the Riff,
Syrians, and Levantines, outcast Europeans, and an occasional
Hindu, with Turks and Greeks, and people from the utmost regions
of the Oriental world, they all are there, and always on the
move, travelling about as if some not too swiftly circulating
quicksilver ran in their veins; whither they go or why, whence
come from, and what urges them to wander up and down, is to me
inexplicable, and forms one of the many of the unfathomed and
unfathomable problems of the East.&nbsp; Not that I mean the
various passengers whom I have named bulk largely in the
population of Morocco, but they are there, and every now and then
one feels how all the Oriental world is linked together by
nomadic habits, from Bagdad to Wad Nun, and from Shiraz to the
oases of the Sahara.</p>
<p>In Morocco the prevailing tone is greyish white; men&rsquo;s
clothes, and houses, towns, bushes, tall umbellifer&aelig;,
nodding like ghosts in autumn, all are white; white sands upon
the shore, and in the Sahara, and over all a white and saddening
light, as if the sun was tired with shining down for ever on the
unchanging life.&nbsp; In no part of Morocco I have visited does
the phrase &ldquo;gorgeous East&rdquo; have the least meaning,
and this is always noted by the wandering Easterns, who find the
country dull and lacking colour compared to Asia, or as the Arabs
call it, &ldquo;Blad Es Shark.&rdquo; <a
name="citation214"></a><a href="#footnote214"
class="citation">[214]</a></p>
<p>Almost all day on the Maidan behind our tent <a
name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>football
went on (called in Arabic El Cora), and every one joined in,
middle-aged men, slaves, and the various hangers-on about the
place, the Kaid&rsquo;s sons playing furiously and whilst the
game went on they were not more respected, and received as full a
share of kicks, shoves, trips, and pushes as did all the
rest.&nbsp; The ball they used was little larger than a
pomegranate; no rules seemed to be observed, for everybody
pushed, shoved, bit, scratched, and kicked as it seemed best to
him, and as they had no goals, but played simply to drive the
other players back, the play was wild, and now and then extremely
savage, and I saw a man get his shoulder dislocated after a
violent fall.&nbsp; Still I sat watching it with great delight,
sometimes for hours, as certainly they played it with their whole
souls, shouting and yelling, leaping like roe, and everybody
playing off side when it seemed good to him, and glorying in his
crime.</p>
<p>Towards midday came the Chamberlain, bringing back our guns
with many thanks and offers of purchase, which we had to decline,
as neither of the guns belonged to us.&nbsp; With him he brought
a double-barrelled hammerless gun in good condition, and with the
maker&rsquo;s name (Green, Haymarket, London) engraved upon
it.&nbsp; He said it was the Kaid&rsquo;s, who set great store by
it, having received it as a present from a merchant on the coast,
and specially he wished to know if the gun was what would be
called of first-rate workmanship in England.&nbsp; I told him
that it was and probably cost about twenty pounds, and that the
son of our Sultana could buy no better or more expensive weapon,
unless, which I said did not seem probable to me, he had his guns
adorned with gold or precious stones.</p>
<p>But better than the guns, or talk of guns, was the invitation
which he brought from the Kaid, saying he would like to see us in
the afternoon.&nbsp; As such an <a name="page216"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 216</span>invitation was, in our position,
really a command, I hesitated some time before accepting
it.&nbsp; The Chamberlain saw what was passing in my mind, and to
gild the pill, remarked that had the Governor not been suffering
from his wound, he would have got upon his horse and ridden to
our tent.&nbsp; Though I felt sure that what he said was quite
untrue, still mankind is so constituted that humbug flatters us,
even although we think we see through it.&nbsp; So I accepted,
and Si Mohammed departed after many compliments and with a
promise to come and fetch us, and usher us into the Presence, in
the afternoon.&nbsp; Lutaif lamented bitterly that we had no
European clothes with which to endue ourselves, and properly
impress the Kaid.</p>
<p>It must not be forgotten that in the East (and
Mogreb-el-Acksa, though it means Far West, is perhaps as Eastern
as any country in the world) European clothes, hard hats,
elastic-sided boots, grey flannel shirts, with braces,
mother-of-pearl studs, two-carat watch-chains, and all the beauty
of our meanly contrived apparels, are to Mohammedans the outward
visible sign of the inward spiritual Maxim gun, torpedo boat, and
arms of precision, on which our civilisation, power, might,
dominion, and morality really repose.&nbsp; A shoddy-clad and
cheating European pedlar, in his national dress, always suggests
to Easterns the might of England somewhere in the offing, and
though they laugh at the wearer of the grey shoddy rags behind
his back, they yet respect him more than if he were attired in
the most beautiful of their own time-hallowed garments, which
they know no European puts on but for some purpose of his
own.&nbsp; But if a European loses respect in wearing Moorish
clothes, he gains in another way, for the Moors are constituted
like other men, and, seeing a man dressed in the clothes they
wear themselves, converse with him more <a
name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>freely,
even if, as in my case, his knowledge of the language is so
slight as to make conversation through an interpreter a
necessity.</p>
<p>So we put on the best we had all cleanly washed, and Lutaif
arrayed himself in a brand new white Selham (burnouse), and
looked more Biblical than ever as he stood forth to be my Aaron,
I having resolved, in order not to make myself ridiculous, to
refrain from saying anything in Arabic, unless I saw a chance to
get some phrase in pertinently, and with effect.</p>
<p>Punctually at half-past two the Chamberlain, accompanied by a
single follower, came for us, and we&mdash;that is, Lutaif,
myself, Mohammed-el-Hosein, and Swani&mdash;walked as
majestically as we could across the deserted Maidan, baking in
the sun.&nbsp; We passed through several courts in which our
friends the horses and the mules were tied, and I observed the
wounded cream-coloured stallion of the Kaid tethered alone and
guarded by a little boy who flapped the flies away with a green
bough.&nbsp; Passing by the door of the Mosque, we saw a preacher
holding forth to a congregation all dressed in white and seated
on the ground.&nbsp; No coughing drowned his saw, no shuffling of
chairs disturbed his eloquence, the listeners sat as solid as
limpets on a rock, whilst his voice rose and fell in measured
cadences, reminding one of the long rollers in a calm, just off
the line.&nbsp; The door of the mosque was a poor specimen of the
bronze-plated work adorned with pious sentences, which can be
seen to such perfection in the mosque at Cordoba; the knocker of
the familiar round Arab pattern, which the Moors have left in
half the houses throughout Southern Spain.&nbsp; A narrow
passage, where a few Jews and tribesmen sat waiting for an
audience, led beneath a horse-shoe archway.&nbsp; Then, climbing
up a dark and almost perpendicular staircase, <a
name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>we emerged
into a lofty ante-room where several men sat on the floor
preparing saffron, which covered half the room with a dense
carpet of bright purple blossom, whilst in a corner lay a clean
white sheepskin with a mass of orange saffron fibres all gathered
in a heap.&nbsp; At one end of the room there was a narrow
doorway, where two men with long guns in their hands kept watch,
and people going out and in continually; some emerging
crestfallen, and others radiant, as in the times when kings, even
in Europe, gave personal audience, and their subjects spoke with
them face to face.</p>
<p>Here we waited almost half an hour, no doubt on purpose to
impress us with the amount of business which the Kaid had to
transact.&nbsp; For myself, I was not sorry, as I had full
leisure to observe all that was going on.&nbsp; Though all the
people in the room and the two guards must have known who we
were, no one showed curiosity, and one man talked to me,
pretending to comprehend all that I said as if he wished to put
me at my ease.&nbsp; We slipped our shoes off at an intimation
from our guide and entered the Presence Chamber, a narrow room
with an &ldquo;artesonado&rdquo; <a name="citation218"></a><a
href="#footnote218" class="citation">[218]</a> ceiling in the
Hispano-Moorish style, but vilely daubed in Reckitt&rsquo;s blue
and dingy red, and with cheap common gilding making it look
tawdry and like the ceiling of an old-fashioned music-hall.</p>
<p>In a recess within the wall two boys were sitting doing
nothing in rather an aggressive way.&nbsp; To my eye they looked
rather androgynous, but not more so than many young men one sees
in Piccadilly on a fine afternoon, and who would tolerate even a
<a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
219</span>suspicion about the noble Shillah race! <a
name="citation219a"></a><a href="#footnote219a"
class="citation">[219a]</a>&nbsp; The room was carpeted with
fine, almost white, matting, over which here and there were
thrown black and white rugs from Sus, all worked in curious
geometric patterns, woven from the softest of wool mingled with
goats&rsquo; hair, and with long fringes at the edge.</p>
<p>Upon a dark red saddle-cloth <a name="citation219b"></a><a
href="#footnote219b" class="citation">[219b]</a> and using an
angle of the wall to lean against, his wounded leg stretched out
before him on a sheepskin, and with cushions at his back, his
Excellency sat.&nbsp; Luckily Arab manners (and in these matters
Berbers follow the Arab lead) prescribe no Kiddush, or, most
infallibly, situated as we were, we should have been obliged to
make it, with the best grace we could.&nbsp; So we advanced, were
formally presented by the Chamberlain, shook hands, and after
being greeted quietly, but courteously, and after Lutaif had
answered quite in the style of Faredi, sat down upon a rug and
leaned against the wall, tucking our feet well underneath our
clothes to show our breeding, and remained silently waiting to
hear what the Kaid had to say.</p>
<p>Mohammed-el-Hosein and Swani advanced, lifted the Kaid&rsquo;s
selham, kissed it, and then retreating sat down, so to speak,
below the salt, whilst in the doorway the two sentinels stood as
unmoved as if <a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
220</span>they saw a Christian every day.&nbsp; Two or three
elders sat round the room as stolid as josses in a temple, two
Talebs, besides our friend the &ldquo;Taleb of the Atlas,&rdquo;
were writing letters, and the Chamberlain stood at attention till
the Kaid waved him to take a seat.</p>
<p>No doubt his Excellency took mental notes of us, and certainly
I looked him over carefully, thinking that in a personal
discussion upon horseback, out on the Maidan, he would prove a
very awkward foe.</p>
<p>Just about forty years of age, thick-set, and dark
complexioned, close black beard trimmed to a double point, rather
small eyes, like those of all his race, he gave no indication of
the cruelty for which he was renowned; not noble in appearance as
are many of the Sheikhs of Arab blood, but still looking as one
accustomed to command; hands strong and muscular, voice rather
harsh, but low, and trained in the best school of Arab manners,
so as to be hardly audible.&nbsp; Just for a moment, and no more,
I got a glimpse of the inside man as I caught his eye fixed on
me, savage yet fish-like, but in an instant a sort of film seemed
to pass over it, not that he dropped his gaze, but seemed
deliberately to veil it, as if he had reserved it for a more
fitting opportunity.&nbsp; By race and language he was a Berber,
but speaking Arabic tolerably fluently, and adapting all his
habits and dress to those in fashion amongst Arab Sheikhs.&nbsp;
His clothes white and of the finest wool, and clean as is a sheet
of paper before a writer marks it black with lies.&nbsp; The
Talebs never stopped opening and writing letters, now and then
handing one to the Kaid who glanced it over and said
&ldquo;<i>Guaha</i>&rdquo; (&ldquo;Good&rdquo;), and gave it back
to have the seal affixed with one of the three large silver seals
which stood upon a little table about six inches high.&nbsp; The
sealing-wax was European, and kept in a box of common cardboard,
which had been mended in several places with little silver bands
to keep the sides together, as <a name="page221"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 221</span>we should mend a lacquered box from
Persia or Japan.&nbsp; Behind the Kaid, to mark his seat, upon
the wall were painted three &ldquo;ajimeces,&rdquo; <a
name="citation221"></a><a href="#footnote221"
class="citation">[221]</a> roughly designed in blue and red and
green in the worst of taste.&nbsp; For furniture, in addition to
the matting and the rugs and leather-covered cushions, the cover
cut into intricate geometric patterns, the room contained a small
trunk-shaped box (perhaps entirely stuffed with gold, Allah
hualem), a Belgian single-barrelled nickel-plated breech-loading
gun hung on a nail, and the before-named double-barrelled English
gun (from the Haymarket of the mysterious Londres or Windres, in
the isle of Mists), a large pair of double field glasses; some
bags of hide, two porous water bottles, a bundle of reed pens,
and two or three pieces of bread, the staff of life, which fills
so large a place in Moorish thoughts and life, and which an Arab
of the old school breaks, but never touches with a knife.&nbsp;
Two negro boys with dirty handkerchiefs, and boughs of walnut,
stood on the right and left hand of the Kaid, and flapped away
the flies.</p>
<p>Oh, what a falling off from when, in Medina el Azahra, the
great palace outside Cordoba, the Greek Ambassador beheld the
Caliph&rsquo;s court, the wonders of the great gold basin filled
with a sea of quicksilver, and the slave boys, beautiful as
angels, who fanned their lord with jewelled fans made of the
feathers of the wondrous bird from Hind, which on its spread-out
tail carries a hundred eyes.&nbsp; But in Kintafi, even the Kaid
himself held in his hand a branch torn from a bush, and flapped
occasionally with his own august hand, when the myriads of flies
became impertinent.</p>
<p>People were going in and out perpetually, like bees into a
hive, or politicians pretending they have <a
name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>important
business in the House of Commons.&nbsp; Some brought petitions,
others begged for mules, horses, a gun, or anything which came
into their minds, and generally the Kaid gave something, for
Moors all pique themselves upon their generosity.</p>
<p>Besides suppliants, Jews and various artificers were hanging
about the ante-room.&nbsp; A silversmith advanced to show a
half-completed silver-sheathed and hafted dagger, engraved with
pious sentences, as &ldquo;God is our sufficiency and our best
bulwark here on earth,&rdquo; and running in and out between the
texts a pattern of a rope with one of the strands left out, which
pattern also ran round the cornice of the room we sat in, and
round the door, as it runs round the doors in the Alhambra and
the Alcazar, and in thousands of houses built by the Moors, and
standing still, in Spain.&nbsp; The dagger and the sheath were
handed to me for my inspection, and on my saying that they were
beautifully worked, the Kaid said, &ldquo;Keep them,&rdquo; but I
declined, not having anything of equal value to give in return,
and being almost certain if I sent a present from Mogador, that
it would never reach its owner&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; So we gravely
put the dagger backwards and forwards with many courteous waves,
&ldquo;It is yours, take it I pray, although unworthy your
acceptance&rdquo;; and I &ldquo;The dagger is in worthy hands,
let it remain with one who had the good taste to order such fine
work, and has the hands to use the weapon when there is
need.&rdquo;&nbsp; A pretty little comedy, my share of which I
conducted through Lutaif, not wishing to fall into barbarities of
speech and make myself ridiculous before so many well-spoken
men.</p>
<p>Slave boys, in clothes perhaps worth eighteenpence, served
coffee, rather an unusual thing in visiting a Moor, for all drink
tea.&nbsp; The tray was copper, beautifully chased, and adorned
with sentences from the Koran, the service varied, and consisting
of a common <a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
223</span>wine glass, one champagne glass of the old-fashioned
narrow pattern, three cheap French cups, and a most beautifully
engraved old Spanish glass goblet out of which his Excellency
drank.&nbsp; The coffee-pot looked like a piece of Empire silver
ware; the coffee excellent, and brought most probably by some
pilgrim from Arabia, and used only on great occasions such as the
present, or at a marriage feast.</p>
<p>The talk ran chiefly upon our journey: why had we come? why
dressed like Moors? where were we going? and why we had no letter
from the Sultan; and, above all, why had we not called at his
house in passing as was usual for all Moors (of our assumed
condition) to do when on the road?&nbsp; I answered that we were
going to Tarudant, that we were dressed as Moors because the
people were not accustomed to see Christians, and might have
insulted us; and that we did not call upon him knowing he had so
many visitors, and not wishing to intrude.&nbsp; As to a
Sultan&rsquo;s letter, that was unnecessary, for I knew well if I
had one he would find some good reason to stop us, under the
pretext that the roads we should encounter would be unsafe.&nbsp;
Moreover, that I had travelled much in Morocco, and did not like
to have a Sultan&rsquo;s letter, for if I had one, no one would
let me pay for food, and that I could not bear to be a burden on
the poor tribesmen amongst whom I passed.</p>
<p>My object in visiting Tarudant seemed to him incomprehensible,
as it was merely curiosity, and for a moment it crossed my mind,
should I make up some reason, such as a vow to make a pilgrimage,
a wish to see if there were mines in the vicinity, or something
which should seem sufficient in his eyes? but in a minute was
glad I had not done so, for he asked, did I know the English
adventurers who, a few months ago, had tried to land upon the
coast of Sus?&nbsp; As at that time I did not, I answered that
they were <a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
224</span>personally unknown to me, but that I totally
disapproved what they had done, especially because Government had
warned British subjects not to try to come to terms with the Sus
chiefs, and that the Sultan had expressed a wish that nothing of
that nature should be done.&nbsp; I added that personally I
reverenced all Governments, especially my own, having been once a
member of the great Council of our Empire, which, I took care to
state, with all the patriotism I could command, was, on reliable
authority, said to be the largest and finest in the world.&nbsp;
He answered &ldquo;Guaha, that is so.&nbsp; Allah himself
appointed Governments, placed the sword of justice in their
hands, and it is for them to say what should be done and see
their wishes are respected.&rdquo;&nbsp; To this I gave assent,
and he inquired was I still of the Council? and, when I answered
no, asked if I had quarrelled with the Vizirs, or done anything
unpleasing to them, or was I only tired of public life?&nbsp;
Finding our parliamentary system too intricate to explain, I said
I was tired of the cares of state, and he replied, &ldquo;Yes,
they are heavy, and I myself have never wished to go to
Court.&rdquo;&nbsp; As I knew well if he ever ventured there his
life was not worth a rotten egg, I applauded his resolve, spoke
of the pleasures of a country life, and, as all hitherto had
passed through the good offices of Lutaif, thought that my chance
had come, and mustering up my Arabic told him he should be
content with what God gave him, for as he was, he was a Sultan in
himself.&nbsp; He smiled, whether at the compliment or my bad
Arabic, I do not know, and beckoned to Mohammed-el-Hosein to come
and speak with him.</p>
<p>Mohammed-el-Hosein advanced, kissed his Selham, and in an
instant became a gentleman and conversed on equal terms.&nbsp;
What they conversed about I do not know, as all their talk passed
in Shillah; but I conclude the Kaid was satisfied with what <a
name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>Mohammed
said, for, signing to the slave who poured the coffee out (a
knave who had a heavy silver earring in his ear, from which
depended a cross-shaped ornament with Solomon&rsquo;s Seal
engraved upon it), he told him to give Mohammed coffee; he did
so, in a white egg-cup, which, as it stood behind the coffee pot,
I had not previously observed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you in Europe
travel about all through the different countries without letters
from your Queen?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No,&rdquo; I rejoined,
&ldquo;we take a letter signed by our Grand Vizir, and show it,
if asked for, at the frontiers of the various
States.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Of course you have one?&rdquo; he
immediately replied.&nbsp; I answered &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; and just
remembered I had left it behind me in the hotel in Mogador; but
luckily he did not ask to see it, or I should have had to show
him a letter which I had with a large seal upon it, which
probably would have answered just as well.</p>
<p>I pressed him to allow us to go on to Tarudant; but he became
mysterious, said the roads were bad, the people dangerous, and
that to save our lives he had acted in the way that he had
done.</p>
<p>Nothing is so disagreeable as to have your life saved in your
own despite.&nbsp; Fancy the feelings of a would-be suicide when
some intruding fellow, like a great Newfoundland dog, jumps in
and pulls him out, and then on landing asks him for his
thanks!</p>
<p>After the coffee, talk ran a good deal upon various things,
polygamy and monogamy, always an interesting subject to all
Orientals, who, being primitive in tastes and habits, set much
account on primary passions (or affections) and think more of
such matters than we do, talking quite openly and without
periphrasis on things we do, but never talk about, or if we do,
lower our breath in talking.&nbsp; Strange and incomprehensible
to a logician that a man should say, I am hungry, thirsty, tired,
and think there is something wrong, indelicate, or indifferent in
mentioning <a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
226</span>the kindred passions, presumably implanted in his body
by the same All-Wise Creator who endowed him with the capacity to
feel thirst, hunger, or fatigue.&nbsp; The Kaid was of opinion
that polygamy was natural to mankind, and asked me if the English
did not really think so in their hearts.&nbsp; It is most
difficult, without having been duly elected, to speak for a whole
nation, so I replied that many acted as if they thought polygamy
was right, but I ventured to opine that advanced thinkers in
general inclined to polyandry, and that seemed to be the opinion
which, in the future, would prevail.&nbsp; This he thought
clearly wrong; but I explained that advanced thinkers were
inclined to hold that women could do no wrong, and that all
infamy of every nature had its root in man.</p>
<p>The prisoners in the Riff <a name="citation226"></a><a
href="#footnote226" class="citation">[226]</a> next were enlarged
upon, and the Kaid asked if they had been released, and what I
thought about the whole affair.&nbsp; Thinking the opportunity
favourable to air my Arabic again, I said laboriously that I had
heard there were some prisoners in the Riff, and added that there
were prisoners also in the Atlas, but no doubt the Sultan would
soon order their release.</p>
<p>His Excellency&rsquo;s wounded leg was, on the whole, the
subject which gave most scope for talk.&nbsp; Neither his Arabic
nor mine was fluent enough to explain, or understand quite fully,
what had taken place.&nbsp; More coffee having been ordered, the
Chamberlain entered into an explanation which Lutaif translated
when I <a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
227</span>(as happened now and then) became bewildered in the
current of his speech.&nbsp; About two months ago the unlawfully
begotten people in the Sus, egged on by certain British traders,
<a name="citation227a"></a><a href="#footnote227a"
class="citation">[227a]</a> had rebelled against their
Lord.&nbsp; The chief offenders were sons of Jews (Oulad el
Jahud), who had withdrawn themselves into a fortified position
three or four days&rsquo; journey from Thelata-el-Jacoub.&nbsp;
The Kaid was ordered to co-operate with the troops in Sus and
bring the rebels back to allegiance, or destroy them all.&nbsp;
Most probably the Kaid had no objection to an expedition out of
his territory, though in point of fact his own allegiance to the
Sultan did not much trouble him.&nbsp; However, mounted on the
white horse, which I saw wounded and drinking in the river, and
leading on his men, the Kaid had advanced against the revolted
tribesmen, who were strongly posted amongst rocks protected with
an outwork of Zaribas <a name="citation227b"></a><a
href="#footnote227b" class="citation">[227b]</a> made of prickly
bushes, from behind which they fired upon the Kaid&rsquo;s forces
who had no shelter, and soon suffered heavy loss.&nbsp; The
saddles emptying on every side, the Kaid was left almost alone
with about twenty men, amongst whom was I who speak (the
Chamberlain remarked in passing, but without any
self-consciousness), his horse received a bullet in the chest,
and another in the head; but still the Kaid advanced, keeping his
horse&rsquo;s head as much as possible between him and the
fire.&nbsp; At last another bullet struck the horse close to the
nose and he wheeling, the Kaid received a bullet in the left leg
and fell!&nbsp; &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said the Chamberlain,
&ldquo;I rode close up to him, and the bullets tore up the grass
on every side, when our men rallying brought us off, I and four
others carrying the Kaid under a heavy fire, and the white
wounded horse walking beside us, till we reached our
camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
228</span>During the tale the Kaid sat imperturbable as a joss
cut out of soapstone, but punctuating all his henchman said with
an occasional &ldquo;Guaha,&rdquo; or some pious ejaculation fit
for a man of quality to use.</p>
<p>In the camp they placed the wounded Kaid upon a mule, and
fighting for the first two days almost incessantly, upon the
evening of the sixth day they brought him home, two slaves having
supported him on either side stretched on the mule, too weak to
sit upright, and with four more helping the wounded horse, which
the Kaid on no account would leave to be the prize of Kaffirs
such as those who dwelt in Sus.</p>
<p>My opinion of all concerned rose not a little on listening to
the history and on learning that the Kaid had hesitated not an
instant to sacrifice his life, and those of all his followers, to
save his favourite horse.&nbsp; And all the time the tale was
going on I thought where had I heard all this before, for every
incident seemed to me in some strange way familiar.&nbsp; At last
I recollected that Garcilasso de la Vega (Inca) in his
&ldquo;Comentarios Reales del Peru,&rdquo; when he relates the
civil wars between the followers of the Pizarros and the forces
of the Viceroy, tells how Gonzalo de Silvestre, after the battle
of Huarina, found himself alone upon a horse wounded twice in the
head, and in the chest, and that he gave himself up for lost,
thinking his horse would fall, when &ldquo;feeling him a little
with the bridle, the horse threw up his head, and, snorting, blew
blood through his nostrils and seemed relieved, then went on
galloping, and presently I passed one of our partizans
retreating, badly wounded, on a mule, not able to sit upright for
his hurt, and by him walked an Indian woman, with her hand upon
the wound to stop the blood.&rdquo; <a name="citation228"></a><a
href="#footnote228" class="citation">[228]</a>&nbsp; Gonzalo de
Silvestre and the wounded man and horse all got off with their
lives, <a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
229</span>no doubt the same tripartite deity assisting them who
in his indivisible aspect came to the assistance of the
Chamberlain and of the Kaid.</p>
<p>Could I then undertake to examine the leg and perhaps extract
the ball? was put to me through the medium of the
Chamberlain.&nbsp; For a moment I hesitated, thinking that if the
ball was near the skin I would hazard it, and so earn the eternal
gratitude of the Kaid and be sent on to Tarudant with honour and
with an escort of his followers to guard me on the way.&nbsp; One
look dispelled my hopes, for the wound was high up in the thigh,
close to the femoral artery and had almost healed, although the
patient said it gave him pain, and stopped him from getting on
his horse, though when once mounted he could make a shift to
ride.&nbsp; Reluctantly I had to say I was not able to undertake
so serious a case.&nbsp; The Kaid&rsquo;s face fell, so I advised
him to send for an English doctor who I knew was staying in
Morocco city for his health, and who would have been glad to see
so strange a place, and put the patient upon his legs
again.&nbsp; If he has done so by this time I do not know, or
even if the Kaid made up his mind to send for him; but the chance
for a doctor was unique, and therefore has, most probably, been
missed.</p>
<p>Governors of provinces in Morocco, and throughout the East,
are rather shy of going to the capital, even in such a case as
this; for once there, the Sultan often takes the opportunity of
making them disgorge some of the money which they have plundered
in their government.&nbsp; On the first rumour that the Governor
is in disgrace, the tribe rebels, blockades the castle, burns it
down if possible, and some neighbouring Sheikh sends to the
Sultan and offers a large sum to be made Governor in the
disgraced man&rsquo;s place.&nbsp; Even if things do not go quite
so far as that, a journey in Morocco has its inconveniences, for
generally the <a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
230</span>wives take the chance of the husband&rsquo;s absence to
dig up his money and send it to their friends.&nbsp; This
happened to the Kaid of Kintafi when wounded in the Sus, and he,
on his return finding his money gone, divorced two of his wives,
and treated all the others to some discipline, which the
Chamberlain assured me had restored peace and order to his
Excellency&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>Our interview having lasted almost two hours, we rose to take
our leave.&nbsp; I thanked the Kaid for his continued
hospitality, assured him that I should not easily forget Kintafi,
promised to send him a doctor if he wished, and quite forgot I
was a prisoner.&nbsp; He on his part transmitted his good wishes
through the medium of his henchman and Lutaif, and said he hoped
we would not leave Kintafi for a few days more, as he was anxious
to speak to us again.&nbsp; This was not quite the ending of the
interview I had expected, for it amounted to an order we should
not leave the place, so in conveying to him my best thanks for
all his hospitality, I told him that I would let him know the
latest news about the prisoners in the Riff on my return to
Mogador, and in the meantime hoped Allah would guide him in all
he did, and that he would continue to dispense his hospitality to
all who passed, because, as Sidna Mohammed himself has said,
&ldquo;that hospitality, even when unasked for, blesses both the
host and guest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lutaif, who had the pleasure of translating this farewell, did
not much like his task, but faced it manfully, and so amidst a
shower of compliments we took our leave, and left the presence of
our illustrious host for good.&nbsp; Still an experience not to
have been missed, and differing extremely from the ordinary visit
paid by the travelling European to a Moorish Kaid on equal terms,
that is, when dressed in European clothes, furnished with letters
from the Sultan <a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
231</span>and the ambassador of the traveller&rsquo;s country,
when one drinks tea, exchanges compliments, and learns as little
of the real go on of an Oriental house, as does a man born rich
learn the real workings of the people&rsquo;s minds with whom he
lives his life.</p>
<p>An Eastern potentate of the Arabian Nights was the Kaid, with
all the culture of the Arabs of the Middle Ages absent, but as he
was, the arbiter of life and death in a wide district.&nbsp; A
gentleman in manners, courteous to those whom he had all the
power to treat with rudeness or severity; a horseman and a
fighter; a tyrant naturally, as any man would be if placed in his
position; but no more tyrannical in disposition than is some new
elected County Councillor, mad to make all men chaste and sober
by some bye-law or another; himself a victim to a lewd
Puritanism, and an insatiable love of cant.&nbsp; Half
independent of the Sultan, leading his own troops, dispensing
justice, as he thought he saw it, in his own courtyard, and to me
interesting in special as a sort of after type of those great
Arab Emirs who sprang from the sands of Africa and of Arabia,
shook Europe, flourished in Spain, built the Alhambra and
Alcazar, gave us the Arab horse and the curb bit, and kept alive
the remains of Greek philosophy in Cordoba and in Toledo, when
all the rest of Europe grovelled in darkness; then by degrees
fell into decadence, and sank again into the sands of Africa, to
still keep alive the patriarchal system, the oldest and perhaps
the best conception of a simple life mankind has yet found
out.&nbsp; Allah Ackbar; lost in a wilderness of broadcloth, I
still praise God that such a man exists, if only to contrast him
in my mind with the self-advertising anthropoids who make one
fancy, if the Darwinian theory still holds good, that the God
after whose image the first man was made had surely been an
ape.&nbsp; Through passages and courtyards we reached the open
space on which <a name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
232</span>our tent was pitched, escorted by a guard of men well
armed with guns and daggers, which appendages made them none the
less loth to take a tip on coming to the tent than if they had
been so many gamekeepers, who take their unearned money after a
grouse drive, or a hot corner in the coverts, with an air of
doing you a service, and whose contempt for you is only equalled
by your disgust both at yourself and them.</p>
<p>But, over everyone a change had come, for we had stood before
the face of the great man with honour, and those who scarcely in
the morning returned our salutations, gravely saluted us and
condescended to enquire after our welfare and our health.</p>
<p>Swani and Mohammed-el-Hosein were radiant, more especially
because the Kaid had sent a sheep, which they had already slain
and given to a &ldquo;master&rdquo; (maalem) to roast <i>en
barbecue</i>.&nbsp; Although I personally was disappointed that
we had not been able either to get an answer from the Kaid as to
our return, still less to get permission to go on, yet I was glad
to have seen him, placed as I was, and wondered if an English
Duke in the Georgian times would have treated an Arab wandering
in England, and giving out he was an English clergyman, as well
as the wild, semi-independent Berber Sheikh treated the wandering
Englishman who assumed to pass, not merely as a clergyman, but as
a saint.</p>
<p>Four men appeared bearing the sheep on a huge wooden dish,
smoking and peppered so as to start us sneezing; and when the
Maalem had torn it into convenient portions with his hands, we
all fell to, Lutaif and I with an appetite that civilisation
gives for such a meal; the rest like wolves, or men remembering
the Hispano-Moorish proverb to the effect that meat and appetite
go not always together, though both are sent by God.</p>
<h2><a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
233</span>CHAPTER X.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Early</span> next day the effects of our
audience began to manifest themselves.&nbsp; The sick, the halt,
the lame, and impotent, all besieged the tent, having been kept
away apparently by the uncertainty of the Kaid&rsquo;s attitude
towards the Nazarenes.&nbsp; But as all Europeans are supposed
not only to know something of medicine and to carry drugs about
with them on all occasions, the afflicted fairly besieged me, and
I dispensed my medicines with a freedom quite without fear of
consequences, and not restrained as doctors are in
&ldquo;policed&rdquo; countries, where every now and then the
public fall into a panic when a case of human vivisection,
carried out (upon the poor) in the pure joy of scientific life,
leaks from inside the precincts of some hospital.&nbsp;
Gratitude, which dies with knowledge, but flourishes luxuriantly
as long as the medicine man is a being quite apart, working his
wonders unrestrained by scientific bounds, showed itself in
several ways.&nbsp; Yet, as per usual, most pathetically in
inverse proportion to the riches of the patient, for several who
should have recompensed my skill (or zeal) according to the
goodness of their clothes, slunk off, as people do at home after
street acrobats have been performing, and when the little boy who
has risked his life upon a pyramid of father, big brother, and
several uncles, straining in his baggy cotton tights (which give
him the appearance of a cab horse shaken in the legs), is just
about to come round holding out his tambourine.&nbsp; So I
dispensed my stock, which I <a name="page234"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 234</span>had brought to spread my fame and
smooth my path in Tarudant, quite cheerfully; ophthalmia,
tetanus, sciatica, elephantiasis, ulcers, and twisted limbs, with
rheumatism, deafness, and El Burd, I alleviated by the faith of
those who took my drugs.&nbsp; The more extraordinary and
complicated were the instructions which I gave, the better
pleased the patient was, and sometimes came back twice or three
times to ask if the quinine or seidlitz powder was to be taken on
every fifth or ninth recurring day.&nbsp; One poor Bezonian, for
whom I had prescribed something or other, came in the evening,
and lugging out from underneath his cloak a dirty
pocket-handkerchief, produced a handful of greasy copper coin,
worth, perhaps, one penny halfpenny in all, and with excuses for
his poverty in Shillah, which came to me through Arabic,
entreated me to pay myself for my prescription.&nbsp; I answered
as nobly as I could, &ldquo;The credit is Allah&rsquo;s,&rdquo;
and the poor man advanced, kissed me upon the shoulder, and went
out, perhaps to tell to-day of the great Christian doctor who
would take no fee.&nbsp; Others brought eggs and bread, and these
I took, as it would have been an insult to them to refuse, and
besides that, I fancy the mere idea of having paid made my hell
broths appear more efficacious to the simple folk.&nbsp; Who,
even in England, that does not believe that the two guineas which
he pays to see some great specialist <a name="citation234"></a><a
href="#footnote234" class="citation">[234]</a> in Harley Street
does not advance his case, and were it five I fancy the greater
part of patients would leave the doctor&rsquo;s mansion cured, or
else omit to go, and all is one in cases where faith heals.</p>
<p>My most popular recipe for coughs may yet achieve the
popularity which is reserved for faith-healing amongst the
Christian world.&nbsp; Take four Beecham&rsquo;s <a
name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 235</span>Pills, and
bruise them in a mortar with an ounce of cloves and two of Argan
oil, a piece of rancid butter, and a cup of magia (spirit made
from dates); rub well upon the chest, anoint the feet, and take a
spoonful of the same liquid in tepid water, now and then,
continuing our light and nourishing couscouso and shisha, <a
name="citation235a"></a><a href="#footnote235a"
class="citation">[235a]</a> and please Allah the cough will
disappear.</p>
<p>Tired of dispensing, I strolled out to the olive grove, sat
down, began to smoke, and watched two men seated close by,
dressed in white robes, and evidently of the richer sort.&nbsp;
One read a letter to his friend, with explanations upon every
line, and with apparently some trouble to himself, for every now
and then he drew a character in the sand with his forefinger, and
compared it with the doubtful character in the document he
read.&nbsp; In the same fashion I have seen grave, reserved,
grey-bearded men in South America sit entertained for hours in
&ldquo;painting&rdquo; <a name="citation235b"></a><a
href="#footnote235b" class="citation">[235b]</a> horses&rsquo;
marks upon the sand, and reasoning wisely upon every one of
them.&nbsp; The man who listened said not a word, but looked
entranced with admiration at the deep knowledge of his
friend.&nbsp; I take it, reading and writing should not be
abused, or it may chance with them to fare even as it has fared
with sweet religion, which first a mystery concealed in a learned
tongue, and thus respected and believed without inquiry, then
became understandable by its translation to the vulgar speech,
lost credit, and to-day has fallen into a fashion, and changes in
complexion, form, and authenticity, as quickly as a hat brought
from Paris in the spring falls into dowdiness and becomes
ridiculous almost before the owner is aware.</p>
<p><a name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>We
marvelled greatly that we had not been able to discover what were
the Kaid&rsquo;s intentions in regard to us, and, casting up the
time, found we had passed nine days already in the place.&nbsp;
Curious, in prison, or in a ship, or stuck alone in some wild hut
on prairie, or on Pampa, to remark how long the time seems for
the first few days, and then begins to race, so that before one
is aware a month is past which at the first looked like eternity
to face.&nbsp; And stranger still, how in a week or so, the
newspapers and books, the so-called intellectual conversation,
news of the outside world, the theatres, churches, politics, and
the things which by their aggregated littleness, taken together,
seem important, fall out of one&rsquo;s life.&nbsp; The condition
of one&rsquo;s horse, the weather, crops, the storm, or coming
revolution, all take their places and become as important as were
the unimportant great events which a short time ago, served up
distorted in an evening paper, wiled away our time.</p>
<p>Thus life at Kintafi after a little became quite natural to
us, and at least as cheerful for a continuance as life in
Parliament, in Paris, London, or any other of the dreary hives of
pleasure or of thought.&nbsp; We rose at daylight, drank green
tea and smoked, went down to bathe, came back and breakfasted,
looked at the horses led to water, listened to the muezzin call
to prayers, walked in the olive grove or watched the negroes in
the corn field; engaged in conversation with some of the strange
types, we read el Faredi, speculated on how long the
&ldquo;rekass&rdquo; would tarry on the road from the
Sultan&rsquo;s camp, and wondered at the perpetual procession of
people always arriving at the castle to beg for something, a
horse, a mule, a gun, some money, or in some way or other to
participate in the Kaid&rsquo;s Baraka. <a
name="citation236"></a><a href="#footnote236"
class="citation">[236]</a>&nbsp; Had I but <a
name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 237</span>been
allowed to ride about and explore the country, I should have been
content to stay a month.&nbsp; However, there was no order, and
all those who are not strong enough to disobey have to stick
strictly to an order in the East.</p>
<p>As an example of how orders are obeyed, one day during my
sojourn at Kintafi, Lutaif and I had wandered about a mile
following the Wad el N&rsquo;fiss and crossing it once or twice
to save the bends.&nbsp; As we were walking we had to take our
slippers off and cross barefooted, picking our way over the
pebbles in the fierce stream, which made it difficult to
walk.&nbsp; On our return, just at a ford where the current ran
particularly swift, we met two mounted men, followers of the
Kaid, whom we knew well, and one of whom I had prescribed for in
my character of medicine man.&nbsp; Thinking the chance a good
one, I asked the man to let me ride across, knowing his feet were
hard as leather, and intending to have given him a trifle for
lending me the horse.&nbsp; The man excused himself with many
apologies, and said he had been sent to exercise the horse, and
had no order to let any one ride on it, and dare not upon any
pretext let me get upon its back.&nbsp; He had no reason to be
uncivil, and was no doubt in terror of what the Kaid might do had
the news come to him that he had gone an atom beyond his strict
command.</p>
<p>Easterns of any nation are good company to be thrown with on
an occasion such as the one in which I found myself.&nbsp; Lutaif
had a never failing fund of stories about things he had seen and
heard, and told them with the absolute lack of self-consciousness
<a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>which
alone makes a story pleasant, and which distinguishes an Eastern
story-teller from the Western, who in his story always has an eye
on the effect of what he tells.</p>
<p>At present in the Lebanon it seems there is an exodus of all
the educated young men towards America; and in New York there is
a Syrian quarter where they speak Arabic, carry on small
industries, and, curiously enough, are known to the natives as
&ldquo;the Arabians,&rdquo; a designation which must sound most
strangely to a Syrian&rsquo;s ear.&nbsp; One of these Syrian
young men, but in this instance quite uneducated, and speaking
only a rough Arabic <i>patois</i>, started to try and reach
America, where the streets are paved with gold.&nbsp; Having
shipped as a deck hand on board a steamer at Beirout, he reached
New York.&nbsp; There he was put ashore, and failed to get
employment; wandered about the streets; was taken to the Turkish
Consul, and by him shipped to Marseilles as a vagrant who was
unable to support himself in the free land where every man is
better than his neighbour if he has more money in his
purse.&nbsp; Dropped ashore at Marseilles, he got aboard an
Italian steamer going to the River Plate, was found and flogged,
then fastened to the mast for six or seven hours, and when the
vessel touched at Malaga, shoved ashore, after receiving several
hearty kicks.&nbsp; There, almost starving, and ignorant of
Spanish, he set out to tramp to Gibraltar, about sixty miles
away.&nbsp; But most unluckily he reckoned without the <i>odium
theologicum</i>; for happening to wear a Turkish fez, and Spain
just at that time being engaged in a squabble at Alhucemas, in
the Riff, the country people were in a fervour of religious rage
against the Moors.&nbsp; New York, Marseilles, the Italian
steamer, all were as nothing to what he had to suffer in his
tramp in the land specially the Blessed Virgin&rsquo;s <a
name="citation238"></a><a href="#footnote238"
class="citation">[238]</a> <a name="page239"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 239</span>own.&nbsp; No one would have him in
the villages, and when he asked for bread he met, in the fashion
of the Holy Scriptures, with a stone.&nbsp; The children hooted
him, the shepherds minding their sheep slung pebbles at him, and
after three days&rsquo; journey, in a most miserable plight, he
reached Gibraltar, where he met a Moor, who gave him a bag to
carry to a certain place.&nbsp; The bag turned out to contain
cigars which the Moor wished to smuggle on board a ship.&nbsp; Up
came a policeman, beat him a little with a short club (as he
explained), and took him off before a magistrate.&nbsp; There not
a soul spoke Arabic, so he was remanded to the cells, where, as
he said, he was quite comfortable and better off than in that
cursed &ldquo;town called Spain.&rdquo;&nbsp; At last an
interpreter arrived and the poor man found himself free, but
starving, and in despair crossed to Tangier, and there on my
return I found him saving up coppers to pay his passage once more
to New York.</p>
<p>Back in our tent the staring recommenced, as for some reason
many of the wilder tribesmen were, so to speak, in town,
to-day.&nbsp; They sat outside the tent like sparrows on a
telegraph, and looked at us as if we were the strangest sight
they ever had beheld.&nbsp; Even the stolid glare of a hostile
(or stupid) audience at a public meeting was nothing to their
gaze.&nbsp; At times I thought had we but brought a monkey and an
organ our fortunes had been made, and we should have to buy a
camel to carry off the avalanche of copper coin.</p>
<p>Still there was no sign of the rekass; and so the 28th and
29th slipped past, leaving us still a-thinking, still cavilling,
and wondering how much longer we should have to stay.</p>
<p>Almost the most interesting, and certainly the most pathetic,
of my patients arrived during the 29th.&nbsp; A long, thin,
famine-stricken man dressed in rags begged <a
name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 240</span>me for
medicine for a &ldquo;sad heart,&rdquo; and certainly he had good
cause for sadness, though I fancy that the peseta <a
name="citation240"></a><a href="#footnote240"
class="citation">[240]</a> which I gave him may have done him at
least as much good as the last of my quinine.&nbsp; It appeared
that the late Sultan, Mulai el Hassan, had destroyed his house,
taken his property, and driven him to exile.&nbsp; Quite
naturally the present Sultan had too much filial respect for his
late father to undo any action, just or unjust, that he had
thought fit to do.&nbsp; Therefore my patient, whose &ldquo;sad
heart&rdquo; had stood out for three whole years, was still a
suppliant, and his present errand was to try and interest El
Kintafi in his case.&nbsp; For six long months he had been in the
place trying his luck without success.&nbsp; Sometimes the Kaid
would promise him his help, and then again tell him to come when
he had thought the matter over and resolved what was the best to
do.&nbsp; Meantime the man slept in the mosque by night, by day
stood at the gate, and when the Kaid rode out clung to his
stirrup and implored his aid.&nbsp; He said, &ldquo;I see him
every six or seven days, but there is no hope but in
God.&rdquo;&nbsp; Still he was cheerful, had his rags well
washed, and was as resigned and dignified as I am certain that no
Christian, out of fiction, could possibly have been.&nbsp;
&ldquo;God the great Helper;&rdquo; but then how slow but
merciful in this case, if only by the faith he had implanted to
endure his own neglect.&nbsp; So the sad-hearted man of sorrows
made his notch upon my life, as the old Persian and the Oudad had
done, and still perhaps waits for the Kaid on mornings when his
Excellency rides out to hunt or hawk with a long train of
followers, issuing from the horseshoe arch, with negroes holding
greyhounds in the leash, horsemen perched high on their red
saddles, the sun falling upon long <a name="page241"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 241</span>silver-mounted guns, haiks waving in
the air, whilst from the ramparts of the castle comes the shrill
note of joy the women raise when, in Morocco, men go out to hunt,
to war, to play the powder; <a name="citation241"></a><a
href="#footnote241" class="citation">[241]</a> or when, at
weddings, the bride, stuffed in a gilded cage upon a mule, is
taken home.</p>
<p>An aged Israelite with a long train of mules came from the Sus
that morning.&nbsp; He wore a sort of compromise between Oriental
and European clothes, which gave him an incredibly abject look,
the elastic-sided boots and ivory-handled cane contrasting most
ill-favouredly with his long gaberdine; his ten-carat
watch-chain, with a malachite locket hanging from it, rendering
the effect of his maroon cloth caftan mean and civilised.&nbsp;
He told me that his chief business was to lend money to the
Kaids, and that his mules were packed with silver dollars, being
the interest on the capital lent to various Governors in
Sus.&nbsp; He expressed no fear of any attack upon his caravan;
and when I quoted the saying that &ldquo;if the caravan is
attacked the poor man has nothing to fear,&rdquo; returned,
&ldquo;Nor has the Jew, who is indispensable to the great ones of
the earth.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nevertheless he bore about him several
old bullet wounds, and carried underneath his gaberdine a
first-rate Smith and Wesson pistol, which he said he would not
care to be obliged to use.&nbsp; I put him down as one who, given
the opportunity, would shoot an unbeliever like a dog, having
generally observed that readiness to shoot goes in an inverse <a
name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>ratio with
readiness to talk, and that the man who always has a pistol in
his hand might just as often, for all purpose of defence, carry a
meerschaum pipe.&nbsp; The way he travelled was curious, for, in
the Sus amongst the Berber tribes, he had to take a tribesman, to
whom he paid a certain sum, to see him safely through the tribe,
who, in his turn, delivered him, on leaving his territory, to
another man, and so on right through the country which he had to
pass.&nbsp; This system is recognised throughout the Atlas range,
and generally wherever the Berber tribes inhabit, and is known as
el Mzareg, that is, the protection of the lance, for anciently
the protecting tribesman bore a lance, but, nowadays, usually is
satisfied with the stout cudgel which all hillmen use.&nbsp;
Baruch, the Hebrew with the ivory crutch-handled stick, informed
me that, in the Sus, nearly every Jewish family was obliged to
have his corresponding Mzareg, who protected and also fleeced
them; and that, in consequence, most of those &ldquo;Pedlars of
the ghetto,&rdquo; in spite of all their industry, were
poor.&nbsp; A curious down-trodden race the Atlas Jews,
ostensibly the slaves of every one, and in reality their masters;
for owing to the incapacity for commerce in the Berbers, every
affair where money changes hands has to be brought about by the
assistance of some quick-witted Jew.&nbsp; So, just as in Europe,
though without being in other respects superior to the races
amongst whom they live, the Atlas Jews control the warlike
Berbers as easily and as completely as their brethren control all
those with whom they come in contact on a business footing
throughout the world.&nbsp; Baruch had his home in Mequinez, and
was not from Toledo, but an Oriental Jew, his people, as he said,
having come into Morocco after the great dispersion, and he
himself being of the tribe of Benjamin; though, when I asked him
how he knew, he said it was a tradition in his family, <a
name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>and that
the ancients never spoke untruth.&nbsp; Into this matter I
forbore to enter, and generally gave an assent, quoting the
Toledan-Jewish proverb, that &ldquo;if Moses died, Adonai still
survived,&rdquo; <a name="citation243"></a><a href="#footnote243"
class="citation">[243]</a> which he at once knew in its Arabic
form, and asked me, as Israelites in the East will often do if
you appear to know a little of their lore, if I, too, was of the
chosen race.&nbsp; This worthy Baruch, in appearance like a head
cut out of walnut wood, set round with fleecy wool, asked me,
when passing Mequinez, to remember I had my house there, and said
that I should find him, Baruch ben Baruch, as a father and a
friend.&nbsp; Unfortunately, since then I have not passed
Mequinez; but, if I do so, hope to eat my &ldquo;adafina&rdquo;
in my father&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>These promises and resolutions one makes, in passing through
the world, to return to some place which has struck our fancy, to
see some friend who lives ten thousand miles away, are like the
apple blossoms blown across a lawn by a May wind; for are not
dead flower leaves and broken promises but the illusions of a
possibility which might have turned out bitter in the
fruit?&nbsp; So, our medicine done, our stock of patience almost
exhausted, another day went past, leaving us no other resource to
pass the time but to lounge up and down the Maidan, and when
evening came welcome the sunset on the spacious amphitheatre of
hills.</p>
<p>As the sun sank, the ochre-coloured earth began to glow, each
stunted hill bush stood out and became magnified, the rose and
purple streaks of light shifted and ran into each other; then
faded into violet and pale salmon-colour haze and falling on the
snow-capped hills lighted them up, making them reverberate the
light upon the rose-red walls and yellow towers, so that the
castle seemed to burn, and the muezzin upon his tower appeared to
call the faithful to their prayers from a red stalk of flame.</p>
<h2><a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
244</span>CHAPTER XI.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Early</span> upon the morning of the 30th
we were astir, and heard a report that a rekass had been seen
entering the castle-gates the night before.&nbsp; Still,
everything went on as usual at Thelata-el-Jacoub, men came and
went, tall Arabs and squat Shillah; our animals all stood
dejected and half-starved; a little pup having made friends with
my Amsmizi horse, who played with him in a perfunctory way.&nbsp;
The prisoners on the flat roof sprawled in the sun, passing the
Peace of God, on terms of absolute equality with other men, who
paused and gravely gave them back their salutation; birds drank
and bathed in the little mill-stream under the oleander bushes;
butterflies, marbled and black-veined whites, argus,
fritillaries, and others quite unknown to me floated along in the
still air, or hung suspended over the petals of a flower, and the
brown earth of the Maidan gave back the heat like a
reflector.</p>
<p>Still no tidings of our long looked for orders to be
gone.&nbsp; All our companions in adversity, the Persian, the man
with the &ldquo;sad heart,&rdquo; the tribesmen in the tent which
had been pitched close to our own; even the three Sheikhs from
Sus at last had gone, having, after their long delay, settled
their business and assured me of their friendship should I visit
Sus, their minds made up never again to venture inside the
lion&rsquo;s den.&nbsp; Our tents alone, like mushrooms, dotted
the Maidan, and over all the valley the late autumn sun shed a
deep calm, making the hills stand out as <a
name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 245</span>if cut out
of cardboard in the middle distance of a theatre.</p>
<p>The enormous mud-built castle, with its flat roofs and
flat-topped flanking towers, took a prehistoric air, and for the
first time I imagined I was looking at some old Carthaginian
building; for its architecture resembled nothing I had ever seen,
being as unlike an Arab Kasbah as to a feudal castle in the
north, with somehow a suggestion of a teocalli, such as Bernal
Diaz, or Cortes, described in Mexico; or as if related in some
curious way to the great buildings in Palenque, temples at Apam,
or the more ancient dwellings of the Aztec race upon the Rio
Gila.&nbsp; Sheep walked behind their shepherds, who played upon
reed pipes as in the times of Hesiod; goats went to pasturage,
the kids skipping and playing with the ragged boys, whilst from
the distance came the wild sound of the Moorish Ghaita, which,
like the bagpipes, is ever most alluring heard from afar; from
the hills floated the scent of thyme, germander, gum cistus, and
the aromatic undergrowth of this last outpost of the European
flora, jutting into the sands of Africa.&nbsp; The river prattled
on its stony bed, and on its bank the horses of the Kaid went
down to drink, and listlessly I strolled to look at them,
thinking, perhaps, that I should have to wait until the autumn
rains had made the mountain paths impassable, and that the Kaid
would be obliged to send me back against his will through the
mysterious passes of the south.</p>
<p>As I mused, drinking in the strange semi-Arcadian,
semi-feudalistic scene, the Chamberlain, attended by his guards,
crossed the Maidan, came to my tent, and, sitting down, informed
me that it was the pleasure of the Kaid that we should
start.&nbsp; I asked had the rekass arrived from the Sultan; but
the Chamberlain would give no definite reply, until I told him
that our men had seen the messenger arrive.&nbsp; What <a
name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>were the
exact terms of the Sultan&rsquo;s message I did not learn, but
they could not have been extremely pleasant, either for me or for
the Kaid; for in Morocco the Sultan never likes to be put in the
position of risking complications with Europeans who might appeal
to their home Government, and usually casts all the onus both of
action and of failure on his Kaids.</p>
<p>Now was the time to make a last despairing effort to go on to
Tarudant; therefore, I tried the Chamberlain in every way I could
think of, but without success.&nbsp; Though I had not by this
time half the money with me, I offered him a hundred dollars, to
which he answered as before, &ldquo;What is the use to me of a
hundred or a thousand dollars without my head?&rdquo;&nbsp; I
shifted ground, and said I could not think of leaving without a
personal interview with the Kaid to thank him for his
hospitality.&nbsp; But here again the faithful Chamberlain was
ready with a message, &ldquo;that it pained his Excellency not to
receive me, but his wound had broken out afresh, and that he sent
many salaams and wished me a prosperous journey back to the
coast.&rdquo;&nbsp; So as a last resource I asked the Chamberlain
&ldquo;What if I get on horseback, and ride straight on to
Sus?&rdquo; only to be met with a grave question if I thought I
had the best horse in the valley, and if, supposing any tribesman
was to fire by accident, I thought my clothes were stout enough
to turn a ball.</p>
<p>Seeing there was no chance, I made a virtue of necessity,
ordered my tent to be taken down, and all got ready for the
road.</p>
<p>The Chamberlain behaved with infinite tact, allowing no one to
come near us, either to steal or ask for money, and took his
&ldquo;gratification&rdquo; with an air of having earned it by
laborious work; then shook my hand, and said he hoped some day to
meet me, and that I was to think he had only acted as he had, by
the orders of his chief.&nbsp; He then shook hands, first <a
name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 247</span>with
Lutaif, then with Mohammed-el-Hosein and Swani, and took his
leave, leaving us all alone on the Maidan, in a broiling sun,
with nothing to eat, and ten or twelve hours of the hardest
mountain roads to pass before it was possible to procure food for
our animals or for ourselves.&nbsp; How all the others felt I do
not know; but for myself, when I reflected on my journey lost, my
twelve days of detention, and how near I had been to reaching
Tarudant, being stopped but by the merest chance, I felt inclined
to laugh.&nbsp; Knowing that almost all the houses were in ruins
on the way, and that the only place where it was possible to buy
barley for the mules was at a little castle called
Taquaydirt-el-Bur, which belonged to the Kaid, and the Sheikh of
which was known as a fanatical and disagreeable man, I sent
Lutaif to the castle for the last time to get a letter from the
Kaid to his lieutenant on the road.&nbsp; Quite evidently they
were determined we should go, for in about half an hour Lutaif
returned with the letter and a negress carrying some bread and
couscousou, on which we made a hearty breakfast, knowing that we
should get nothing more till night.</p>
<p>When one has little to pack, arrangements for a journey are
soon despatched, and we had nothing but our tent and a few rugs;
no food, no barley for the mules, and the precious stock of
medicines, which was to have made my name in Tarudant, was long
run out.&nbsp; The men all worked like schoolboys packing to go
home, especially Mohammed-el-Hosein, who had never thought to
leave the place alive, or at the least to lose his mules, and be
well beaten for his pains.&nbsp; His spirits rose enormously, and
he assured me he was ready even now to try the road by
Agadhir.&nbsp; Swani sang Spanish and English sailors&rsquo;
songs, not to be quoted until the &ldquo;woman movement&rdquo;
either makes women accustomed to the tone of much of
sailors&rsquo; conversation, or else refines our mariners and <a
name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 248</span>makes their
talk more fit for ears polite, or hypocritical.&nbsp; Ali was
like a man in a dream, and felt his mule all over to see if it
had suffered by the long exposure to heat and rain, with barely
any food.&nbsp; It winced, and kicked at him to show its love,
and to assure him that its spirit was not injured by its
fast.</p>
<p>So all being ready, and not a soul about, I mounted, took the
black Amsmizi horse by the head and felt his mouth, touched him
with the spur, and let him run across the empty Maidan, turned
him and made him rear, and plunging down the steep path to the
beach, just met the horses of the Kaid for the last time, being
led out to drink.&nbsp; The wounded cream colour, now almost
quite recovered, stood up and gave a long defiant neigh, and as
we rode under the castle walls upon the stony bed of the
N&rsquo;fiss, the figure of the Chamberlain appeared, and waved
to us in a friendly fashion, so that my last impression of the
place was his grave figure, silent and robed in white, and the
fierce stallion neighing on the beach.</p>
<p>About a mile, following the river&rsquo;s bed, the trail leads
through a scrub of oleanders, rises and enters a fantastic path
worn in the limestone rock, cut here and there into pyramids and
pinnacles by time, by traffic, and by winter rains, and looking
something like the &ldquo;seracs&rdquo; formed in the ice upon
the edge of certain glaciers.&nbsp; We followed it about a
quarter of a mile, and turning, saw the castle of the
Thelata-el-Jacoub for the last time.</p>
<p>But as I checked my horse, who, now his little spurt of spirit
over, felt the twelve days&rsquo; lack of food, and hung his
head, I gazed upon the monstrous mud-built, yellowish-red pile,
marked once again the olive grove upon the edge of the Maidan,
just caught the mosque tower with its green metallic tiles, the
cornfields, and the wild, narrow valley stretching to the
snow-capped hills, the river like a steel wire winding <a
name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>in and out
between its steep high banks, and in my heart thanked fortune
which, no doubt for some wise (though hidden) purpose of its own,
had kept me prisoner for twelve well-filled days in such a
place.&nbsp; Lutaif, in spite of all his piety, as he took his
last look at the valley of Kintafi, I fancy muttered something
which sounded like an imprecation on Mohammed and his faith, but
yet confessed that even in the Lebanon there was no valley wilder
or more beautiful than that of the N&rsquo;fiss.&nbsp;
Mohammed-el-Hosein felt at his beard as if to assure himself it
still grew on his chin, and without stint cursed Kaid and castle,
tribe, place, and all the dwellers in it to the fourth and fifth
generation of the sons of mothers who never yet said No.&nbsp;
Swani was of opinion that of all men he had seen the Shillah were
the most like Djins, and beat even the Jaui, <a
name="citation249"></a><a href="#footnote249"
class="citation">[249]</a> who, as all men knew, are sprung from
monkeys, in ill-favouredness of face and wickedness of heart.</p>
<p>Our feelings thus relieved, we set ourselves to drive our
half-starved beasts over the mountain roads.&nbsp; The miles
seemed mortal, and the scenery, though wonderful enough, chiefly
remarkable for the unending hills, the frequent elbows made by
the N&rsquo;fiss, now deeper and much fiercer than when we came,
owing to the recent rains, which forced us to cross repeatedly
and get wet every time; for the snow, which now lay thickly on
the higher hills, though the sun was hot, still made the wind as
cold as winter, and our clothes like paper on our backs.&nbsp; As
we spurred along, calling, when a mule stumbled upon a narrow
path above the river, upon Sidi bel Abbas, the saint of
wayfarers, we racked our brains to discover how we had been found
out.&nbsp; The sun, the winds, the want of food, the rain and
dust of the road, had by <a name="page250"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 250</span>this time rendered us almost as dark
as Moors.&nbsp; So we were certain that we looked the character,
for all the passers-by saluted us with &ldquo;Peace&rdquo; and
never turned their heads to look at us, taking us evidently for
travellers from the Sus.&nbsp; My own idea was that the man we
had taken from Amsmiz had passed the word along the road.&nbsp;
The others thought, some one thing, some another, and so we
talked away, till at the last Mohammed-el-Hosein resolved the
matter, saying that Allah had not wished us to succeed.&nbsp;
Once more we crossed the rugged hill, where I had seen the
miserable donkey fallen on the road surrounded by his wretched
owners, or compeers.&nbsp; Again we stopped to rest the animals
under the oleander bushes by the stream; but this time all
dejected, hungry, and without refreshment, but a pipe of kief,
which Ali brought triumphantly out of a dirty bag, and which we
smoked by turns, sitting like Indians at a council, waiting for
the word.</p>
<p>Just about sundown we came to Taquaydirt-el-Bur, to find it
full; a sort of festival in process in the mosque; mules, horses,
donkeys, and armed men pervading all the place; a whistling north
wind blowing from the snow; nothing to eat, and to be kept at
least an hour sitting upon our beasts, whilst the Sheikh read the
letter we delivered from the Kaid.&nbsp; At last a filthy negro
came and called us in; whilst riding through the dark and
tortuous passage to the inner court, my horse fell twice, once on
a donkey and again upon a mule: and the confusion, struggling,
kicking, cursing, and plunging in the dark, made me despair of
getting through without a broken bone.&nbsp; When we emerged the
inner court was full; men slept beside the donkeys, upon their
pack-saddles; and on the plaster benches running round the wall
beside them were their guns, their daggers, and their quarter
staffs; underneath their heads their money, <a
name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 251</span>valuables,
corn for their horses, or anything they chanced to value
most.&nbsp; Luckily none of them knew that we were Christians,
but thought most likely we were guests the Sheikh considered
worthy of his care; for no one looked at us, and we were glad to
pack into a room above an oil-press, smelling abominably of oil,
filthy, and with an opening in the roof through which we saw the
stars.&nbsp; Upon the doors and shutters were some most curious
concentric patterns cut deep in the wood.&nbsp; They were not
Arab, yet not like any European work, nor yet were made by Jews;
but they reminded me, as the Kasbah at Kintafi had done, of the
strange temples of Palenque, the patterns on the Aztec Calendar,
and the Sacrificial Stone built into a side wall of the great
church at Mexico.&nbsp; Miserably we sat squatted before a pan of
charcoal trying to dry our clothes, and after some hours&rsquo;
waiting, a man appeared with a dish of eggs fried in
high-smelling Argan oil, which we despatched at once, and tried
to sleep; but between the cold and the assaults of every kind of
insect, found it impossible, tired with the journey and hungry as
we were.&nbsp; All through the night a sort of Tenebr&aelig;
seemed to be going on in the neighbouring mosque; ghaitas were
played, and every now and then a man broke out into a long high
chant, the congregation answering him at stated intervals.&nbsp;
Long before day I roused our people up, saddled, and picked our
way through the courtyard where the travellers were still buried
in sleep, then got upon the road just as the stars were paling,
and a whistling wind blowing from off the snow, which chilled us
to the bones.&nbsp; Mohammed-el-Hosein and Swani were afraid the
Kaid might change his mind and send men after us to bring us
back; so we pushed on as fast as we could go for about four
hours, until the half-starved beasts began to tire, then walked a
spell, and finally sat down to rest (this time without <a
name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>even a pipe
of kief), and let the beasts try to pick up some grass.</p>
<p>Until that moment, so hurried had been our journey, I had not
determined where to go; and after consultation, it being manifest
we could not reach Morocco city by nightfall with our jaded
beasts, and as I was not anxious to camp in the mountains another
night without a chance of food, I determined to push on to
Tamasluoght, the Sherif of which, Mulai-el-Haj, I knew and to
whom I had sent a letter from Kintafi, asking him to agitate for
our release.&nbsp; From where we were, the Zowia of Tamasluoght
was distant at least eight hours&rsquo; march, and if we wanted
to arrive with light the time was short enough.&nbsp; So we
pushed on; stumbling along the mountain paths, dismounting now
and then to lead our animals, all silent and occasionally a
little cross.&nbsp; The road branched to the east, and separated
from the Amsmiz path close to the place where we had seen a salt
mine on our journey towards the Sus.&nbsp; Here for the first
time we entered a real cedar forest; the trees not high, rarely
exceeding thirty feet in height; but thick and growing closely so
as in places to exclude the light.&nbsp; The trail led in and out
between the trunks, and at times narrowed to about two feet in
breadth, and went sheer down for seven or eight hundred
feet.&nbsp; Unmindful of the proverb that &ldquo;he who passes a
bridge on horseback looks death in the face,&rdquo; <a
name="citation252"></a><a href="#footnote252"
class="citation">[252]</a> we passed without dismounting till
Lutaif&rsquo;s saddle slipping almost precipitated him down the
precipice.&nbsp; Dimly, and at an immense depth below, we saw the
salt mine, looking like a glacier, and shining white as snow; the
mode of working being to dig innumerable pits, from which the
water ran into a sort of reservoir, where the salt lay
heaped.&nbsp; Miserable donkeys crawled along the mountain paths,
all grossly overladen; and men passed stripped <a
name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 253</span>half-naked,
but perspiring even in the chilly air, bent, like Swiss porters
carrying tourists&rsquo; boxes, under great loads of salt.</p>
<p>At last we began to leave the mountains, and emerged on to a
broad and fertile plateau, much like Castille, and growing the
same crops of wheat, chick peas and vetches, with the resemblance
increased by the mud-built houses, looking so like the hills that
now and then we came upon a village almost before we could be
sure if the brown heaps were irregularities of the ground, or
houses, so exactly did the colours blend.&nbsp; In one of the
small hamlets we bought bread and fed our horses, and once again
pushed on, till about four o&rsquo;clock, after winding up an
interminable staircase of rock, all of a sudden the plain of
Morocco burst upon us; the great city in the distance, and the
Kutubieh standing like a lighthouse of Islam, to guide the
wanderer home.&nbsp; From thence the descent was rapid; and in
another hour we found ourselves in a different climate, and again
came to a country where it had not rained for months, but was
burnt up and dry, with all the water-courses turned to brown
holes, and a dull shimmering in the still air broken but by the
grasshoppers&rsquo; shrill note.&nbsp; The next three hours were
mortal, and about sundown our animals reeled through the olive
groves, which for a mile or more surrounded the Zowia of
Tamasluoght.&nbsp; We passed some water wheels, and drank at the
first of them; passed underneath the curious apparatus like a
switchback, supported on brick towers at intervals of a hundred
feet, by means of which water is taken to the Sherif&rsquo;s
house; rode through some sandy lanes, with houses here and there;
came to the gateway, and were met by Mulai-el-Haj in person, who
said he had not thought we should have got out of Kintafi upon
such easy terms.</p>
<p>No one could be more absolutely unlike our late <a
name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>lamented
host than Mulai-el-Haj, an Arab of the Arabs, descended from the
Prophet, but with little of the dignity that rank (in the East)
usually confers on its possessor.&nbsp; A man of peace in fact, a
semi-sacred character, and a sort of cross between the Pope and a
feudal baron of old time; rich, influential, and occupying in the
south the position held in the north by the Sherifs of
Wazan.&nbsp; When at last our diplomats became aware that the
French had secured a footing in Wazan, and by their railway to
Ain Sefra a point of descent on Fez and on Morocco city, it
occurred to them to secure Mulai-el-Haj, as a set-off to the
all-prevailing influence of the French throughout the
north.&nbsp; So they induced our Government to extend British
protection to the Sherif of Tamasluoght; but the protection has
been so grudgingly extended as to be hardly of avail.</p>
<p>Into the ethics of the European occupation of Morocco I do not
propose to go; but if at any time that occupation should occur,
it is certain that Europe would not see us in Tangier.&nbsp; The
French have thoroughly secured the north, and as the Germans will
no doubt bid for some towns upon the coast, it might perhaps be
advisable to take the south, and so control the Sus, secure
Morocco city, and thus keep a way open for the Saharan trade, and
opening Agadhir, or some port on the Wad Nun, check French
advance from St. Louis, Senegal, and Dakar, and their possessions
in the south.&nbsp; I should prefer to see Morocco as it is, bad
government and all, thinking but little as I do of the apotheosis
of the bowler hat, and holding as an article of faith that
national government is best for every land, from Ireland to the
&ldquo;vexed Bermoothes,&rdquo; and from thence to Timbuctoo.</p>
<p>Let us rob on in Europe as we have always done since first the
Vikings sailed their long ships to plunder and to steal.&nbsp;
England has never lagged <a name="page255"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 255</span>behind in all adventures of this
kind, so if there is a general scramble for Morocco, let us have
our share.&nbsp; Statesmen can surely find reasons to justify us,
and if they fail, we can sail in under the Jolly Roger, after the
fashion of our ancestors upon the Spanish main.&nbsp; When we
arrived at Tamasluoght, nothing was farther from my mind than
politics, the advance of empires, ethics of conquest,
Hinterlands, and things of that sort, on which the opinion of the
first fool in the street is just as valuable as that of the
politician fool, who stumbles out his halting speech to his
bemused electors, who elect him for his likeness to themselves in
density of head.</p>
<p>Mulai-el-Haj ushered us into a sort of kiosque, built in the
style of the Alhambra, with a small court in front, in which grew
cypresses and oranges, and would hear no word of anything before
he had seated us on a comfortable divan in the recess of a window
in his guest-chamber, which opened on a little garden where a
fountain played, the water splashing on a marble basin, and the
scent of flowers rising up to the room.&nbsp; After the Arab
fashion he never left us for a moment, <a
name="citation255"></a><a href="#footnote255"
class="citation">[255]</a> and whilst a repast was being got
ready, set tea before us, and then coffee, and, to pass by the
interval, fresh bread and butter in a cracked though lordly
dish.&nbsp; All was perfectly appointed in Arab style, the china
French, the basin in which we washed our hands of brass most
beautifully worked, and a black (uncomely) slave girl with heavy
silver anklets handed round the cups.&nbsp; In her confusion at
the sight of Christians, instead of handing us a napkin she
handed something which looked like the trimming of her drawers,
<a name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 256</span>and
being rebuked in Shillah, retired in tears, and another equally
ill-favoured damsel took her place.&nbsp; Her name I think was
Johar, and the Sherif explained with gravity that negresses were
as immodest as the hens, and that the slave had better have kept
the trimming of her drawers to veil her face, though, as he said,
what with the tattoo marks and negro features it contained little
to tempt the eyes of a believing man.&nbsp; To this I gave a
qualified assent, and through the medium of Lutaif guided the
conversation on to more general grounds, on which a man, used
from his youth, as Europeans are, to think all women angels in
disguise, might comfortably join.</p>
<p>The Sherif having gone to the mosque for a brief interval, I
walked into the courtyard to see my horse, and found him standing
dejectedly and too worn out to eat; the mules exhausted, one of
them lying down, with the men sitting beside them, too tired even
to light a fire.&nbsp; Lutaif, who was not much accustomed to
such trots, and who moreover had ridden a tired mule for most
part of the day, had nearly fallen asleep during the tea and
coffee and the long talk with the Sherif, now was a little
rested, and strolled with me about the place.</p>
<p>The house was built in the usual Moorish style; with
crenelated walls, flanking towers, and dome-shaped roofs.&nbsp;
It had innumerable courts, a mosque, a women&rsquo;s wing, a
granary, store-houses, baths, and everything in the first style
of modern Arab taste.&nbsp; All round the houses stood cypresses,
many of great age and height; over the mosque two or three
palm-trees waved, and oranges and olives extended for some acres
upon every side.&nbsp; There was a garden in the Eastern taste,
where water trickled in a thousand little rills; canes fluttered,
rustling like feathers in the air; jasmine and honeysuckle
climbed up the azofaifa trees, sweet limes and lemons with
pomegranates were dotted here and there; some <a
name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
257</span>periwinkles, but larger and paler than those grown in
Europe, grew in the grass; here and there stood geranium bushes,
straggling and run to seed.&nbsp; Over it all brooded the air of
decadence, mixed with content, which makes an Eastern garden that
of all others where a slothful and religious man should find
heart-ease, and reading in some book of things beyond the power
of intellect, leave them without solution, and sit still giving
thanks for gardens as a true Christian should.</p>
<p>The inside of the house was decorated in a sort of
pseudo-Persian style, with double doors all gilt, each with a
little horseshoe opening in the middle of it through which to
pass, and on each side a formal tree like those upon the binding
of a Persian manuscript.&nbsp; In fact, a modern replica of the
Alhambra done without art, the gildings and the columns common,
heavy and overcharged, and nothing really good except the iron
gratings of the windows, and the tiles which, made to-day in Fez,
seem to have but little deteriorated in glaze and colour from
those left by the Moors in Spain.</p>
<p>The prayers over, the Sherif came back to keep us company, and
sat till midnight talking of all sorts of things.</p>
<p>He appeared to think that we had great luck in not having been
sent as prisoners to the Sultan&rsquo;s camp, for if we had been
sent, we might have remained for weeks journeying about with the
army before we were released.&nbsp; I was not sure if on the
whole I was glad to have missed the experience, but as it would
have been impossible to explain my reasons, I held my
peace.&nbsp; Mulai-el-Haj, being an English protected subject,
felt or assumed to feel great interest in English things.&nbsp;
He asked most ceremoniously after our Grand Vizir (Lord
Salisbury), was curious about the Queen, talked of the rising of
<a name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>the
Afridis, and hoped that God would give the victory to our armies,
a consummation which in his heart of hearts he could not really
have wished, for no Mohammedan ever desires that Kaffirs shall
triumph over &ldquo;those of the faith.&rdquo;&nbsp; His
questions answered with great detail, he launched into a
disquisition on the present state of things in Morocco under the
Vizir-ship of Ba Ahmed, &ldquo;for the young Sultan rules but by
his hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What he communicated may or may not have been his real
opinion, for Arabs are apt to say that which they think will
please their hearers; but situated as he was&mdash;that is, being
a rich, powerful (and tolerably selfish) man&mdash;it may be that
his words really conveyed his thoughts.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have known
tyrannies by Allah, and the late Sultan, Mulai-el-Hassan (may God
have pardoned him), was not a lamb.&nbsp; His father was
something sterner, and their vizirs were apt, as vizirs always
are, to fill their purses at the expense of powerful men.&nbsp;
But since I first became a man, never a state of things so bad as
now.&nbsp; Ba Ahmed passes all measure, grinds the faces of the
poor, maintains the Sultan in a state of tutelage, taking his
wives if so it pleases him, and sending them to his own house; he
also sends the public money into France and puts it in their
cursed banks, so that if the time for vengeance comes, he can
escape and live upon it.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then looking round the room
and moving up his cushions close to mine and laying one hand on
my arm, he asked, &ldquo;Do you catch all I say?&rdquo; for poor
Lutaif had almost dropped asleep.&nbsp; I understood him as he
spoke slow and plainly, and he began.&nbsp; &ldquo;Has England
quite forgotten us, or does she sleep?&nbsp; Time was when she
was not wont to wait long when a country lay open as does Morocco
to her power.&rdquo;&nbsp; I thought he understood our policy and
what has made us so beloved by everyone, so nodded, and he went
on.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can insure the southern <a
name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 259</span>chiefs of
all the tribes.&nbsp; I, Mulai-el-Haj, who speak, but who through
the intrigues of Ba Ahmed dare not leave his house; twice have
they fired at me walking in my own garden, once when on my horse
almost a mile outside, and even now I know that men are waiting
for me did I go out.&nbsp; But still I can insure the southern
chiefs from here to Tazerouelt, westward to Tuats, to Tafilet,
and through the Atlas; the dwellers in the plain around the city
of Morocco all either send emissaries or visit me by night.&nbsp;
I tell you, even the wildest of those who think a Christian is
not a human being are so hard pressed, that if the English came
they would meet them on the road and pour out milk. <a
name="citation259"></a><a href="#footnote259"
class="citation">[259]</a>&nbsp; God instituted government, as he
made moon and sun, set one by day to shine, the other to guide
wanderers by night, and as he set the stars in the blue heavens,
so he set Kaids and Governors, Sheikhs, Mokadems, Cadis, and all
the hierarchy of rulers, each in his place to rule mankind.&nbsp;
The tail can never be so honourable as is the head, and whilst
men still exist they must be ruled, ruled justly; but this Ba
Ahmed knows no justice in his heart.&rdquo;&nbsp; Passion,
O&rsquo; me, I thought, he is no socialist, nor for that matter
is the poorest Arab, all thinking that authority came straight
from God.&nbsp; Then he continued, &ldquo;For two years I have
never dared to go to Morocco city, though but three hours
away.&nbsp; My houses there are ruined.&nbsp; Ba Ahmed has taken
one of them, and the other stands open a prey to wind and rain,
with all the woodwork torn away and burnt.&nbsp; Your
&lsquo;Bashador&rsquo; two years ago advised me to make friends
if possible with the Vizir.&nbsp; Therefore I bought a female
slave, not to go empty-handed for I knew well that those in
office always expect a present from all those they see.&nbsp;
Three hundred <a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
260</span>dollars did I pay for the girl; not that she was a
houri whom the sheep would lift their heads to look at if she
walked across a field, but passable, and fitting to present to a
man who like Ba Ahmed filled the office of Vizir.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so I went to see my enemy.&nbsp; Why he should be
my enemy I do not know, except that I am rich and am known to
favour England, which he detests; but as it is, may Allah put his
mercy some day into the hearts of flint.&nbsp; The girl I placed
upon a mule, and taking with me twenty or thirty well-armed men,
rode to Morocco city.&nbsp; Arrived before his door, I had to
wait two hours, I a Sherif, to wait two hours to please the
mulatto dog; and then the slave who led me to him brought me
through many passages and left me standing outside a half-opened
door, whilst he went in.&nbsp; Long did I stand there, and being
angry at the indignities that I was passing through, forbore to
listen till at last I heard Ba Ahmed say to his slave,
&lsquo;Where is the man?&rsquo;&nbsp; The negro answered,
&lsquo;He is come,&rsquo; and then Ba Ahmed angrily replied,
&lsquo;Did you not take him where I told you?&rsquo; (<i>i.e.</i>
to be killed), and the slave excused himself, saying: &lsquo;I
thought you wanted him in here.&rsquo;&nbsp; After a moment I
heard Ba Ahmed say: &lsquo;I told you plainly to take him to be
killed, but God has spared him, let him come in.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Then the slave threw the door open, and I advanced, was kindly
welcomed, sat and drank tea, thinking each cup was poisoned, but
made no sign, knowing that Allah, who had spared my life a moment
previously, could turn the poison into sugar, if he willed it
so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We sat and talked, and then I gave the slave girl to
him, and she was led away into his house.&nbsp; I took my leave,
and he with courteous words urged on me return and visit him; but
who that once escapes from the lion&rsquo;s den places his head
again beneath his paw?&nbsp; <a name="page261"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 261</span>God has indeed been gracious to me,
praise his name, The One.&rdquo;&nbsp; As he stopped speaking I
thought, indeed, who that would pity a snake-charmer who is
bitten by a snake, or any one who cometh near wild beasts?&nbsp;
I did not say so, but confined myself to praises of his prudence
and of the special providence which had saved his life.</p>
<p>Then I enquired if he had got my letter from Kintafi, saying
jocularly that I had looked for him to come to my assistance
waving a Union Jack.&nbsp; To my surprise he denied all knowledge
of the letter, and said he had only heard of my captivity by
accident.&nbsp; On going to Morocco city, the day after, I found
a special messenger had been sent off to him bearing the letter;
but after all blessed are they who expect little, they shall be
satisfied.</p>
<p>At midnight, and when Lutaif had long subsided into slumber on
the divan, leaving me to puzzle out the worthy gentleman&rsquo;s
discourse as best I could, he took his leave after urging me
warmly to bear his compliments to our Grand Vizir.&nbsp; I
pitilessly woke up Lutaif and had a consultation with him, what
we should do, it being quite impossible for the animals to return
to Mogador without some rest, and equally impossible to remain at
Tamasluoght, where the Sherif would let us pay for nothing,
either for ourselves or for our beasts.&nbsp; Morocco city was
but three hours off, and as I expected letters there, we arranged
to stop two or three days and feed our animals, and then push on
across the plains for Mogador.&nbsp; Next morning saw us in the
saddle by ten o&rsquo;clock; and after a courteous exchange of
compliments with the Sherif, and renewed entreaties on his part
to put his view of the state of affairs in Morocco before the
Grand Vizir on my return, we took our leave.</p>
<p>Thus for the second time I passed a night at Tamasluoght,
having once, four years before, been there <a
name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 262</span>with Mr.
Harris <a name="citation262"></a><a href="#footnote262"
class="citation">[262]</a> on the occasion when the Sherif was
agitating for British protection; and as I saw him standing
before his door and bidding us good-bye, a courteous, prosperous,
saintly Moorish gentleman, it came back to my mind that I had
said to Mr. Harris that his protection, as far as English
interests were concerned, was thrown away.</p>
<p>If we protect at all, except from pure philanthropy, we should
protect lean, sunburnt sheikhs, who pass their lives on
horseback, and at whose call spears and long guns rise from the
desert like frozen reeds stick through the ice in ponds in winter
time; and if that sort is not available, why those of the same
kidney as the man in whose house I slept next night, Abu Beckr el
Ghanjaui, prince of all Moorish intriguers and diplomatists; one
who will stick to any cause through thick and thin if it is worth
his while, and who, I fancy, if he chose to speak all that he
knows of British policy in Morocco, could make some diplomatic
folk get up and howl, or send them snorting like an Indian pony
about the Foreign Office.</p>
<h2><a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
263</span>CHAPTER XII.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> through the olive groves of
Tamasluoght, the city of Yusuf-ibn-Tachfin <a
name="citation263"></a><a href="#footnote263"
class="citation">[263]</a> lay glistening on the plain, almost
hull down on the horizon.&nbsp; Above the forests of tall date
palms which fringe the town, the tall mosque towers rose, the
Kutubieh and the minaret of Sidi Bel Abbas high above the
rest.&nbsp; From the green gardens of the Aguedal the enormous
stone-built pile of the Sultan&rsquo;s palace, all ornamented
with fine marbles brought from Italy and Spain, towered like a
desert-built Gibraltar over the level plain.&nbsp; Across the
sea-like surface of the steppe long trains of camels, mules, and
men on foot crawled, looking like streams of ants converging on a
giant ant-hill, whilst in the distance the huge wall-like Atlas
towering up, walled the flat country in, as the volcanoes seem to
cut off Mexico from the world outside.&nbsp; The situation of
Morocco city much resembles that of Mexico, which has a
pseudo-Oriental look, the flat-roofed houses and the palm trees
completing the effect.</p>
<p>A hot three hours, kicking our tired beasts along, brought us
outside the city walls, and passing underneath the gate, which
zig-zags like an old Scottish <a name="page264"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 264</span>bridge, we emerged into the sandy
lanes running between orange gardens, which form a kind of suburb
of the town, and where the Soudanese, the men from Draa and the
Wad Nun, do mostly congregate.&nbsp; No one would ever think,
from the aspect of the lanes, unpaved and broken into holes by
winter rains, that he was actually inside a city which is
supposed to cover almost as much ground as Paris.&nbsp; It took
us almost three-quarters of an hour to ride from the outside
walls to the centre of the town.&nbsp; We passed through narrow
lanes where camels jammed us almost to the wall; along the
foot-paths beggars sat and showed their sores; dogs, yellow,
ulcerous and wild as jackals, skulked between our horses&rsquo;
legs.&nbsp; At last we came out on an open space under the tower
of the Kutubieh, in which square a sort of market was in
progress, and a ring of interested spectators sat, crouched, and
stood, intent upon a story-teller&rsquo;s tale.&nbsp; I sat a
moment listening on my horse, and heard enough to learn the story
was after the style of the Arabian Nights, but quite
unbowdlerised and suitable for Oriental taste.</p>
<p>A certain prince admired a beauteous dame, but an old Sultan
(always the wicked baronet of Eastern tales) desired her for his
harem, and engaged a certain witch, of whom there were great
store throughout his territory, to cast a spell upon the prince,
so that the lady should fall into a dislike of him.&nbsp; He, on
his part, resorted to a wizard who stirred the ladies of the
Sultan&rsquo;s harem up to play strange pranks and turn the
palace upside down, let young men in o&rsquo;nights, stay out
themselves too late, and generally comport themselves in a
discreditable way.&nbsp; A faithful slave at last made all things
right, and after a most realistic love scene the prince and
princess were married and lived happy ever after; or, as the
story-teller, a sad moralising wag, remarked, until the prince
should take <a name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
265</span>another wife.&nbsp; Humanity, when crushed together in
the heat, either in London ball-rooms or in waste places in
Morocco city, sends up a perfume which makes one regret that the
cynical contriver of the world endowed us with a nose.&nbsp;
Therefore I waited but a little and rode on, turning occasionally
to take a look at the great mosque and the tall dusty
tower.&nbsp; The outside of the mosque, the name of which in
Arabic means Mosque of the Books, from the word Kitab, a book, is
not imposing.&nbsp; What it is inside I believe no Christian
knows.&nbsp; Had I that moment, dressed as I was, sunburned and
dirty, got off and entered it, I might have seen, but the thought
did not cross my mind, and afterwards, when known for a European,
it might have cost my life.&nbsp; The tower springs straight from
the sandy square as the Giralda rises from the level of the
street in Seville.&nbsp; One man built both, so runs tradition,
and certainly the Kutubieh tower to-day reminds one greatly of
the description of the Giralda when San Fernando drove out the
Moorish king of Seville, and planted the banner with the Castles
of Castille above the town.&nbsp; The same gilt globes, of which
the Spanish speak, are on the Moorish tower, and the same little
cupola which the Christians took away in Seville, replacing it by
a renaissance &ldquo;fleche,&rdquo; upon which stands the
towering figure cast by Bartolom&eacute; Morel.&nbsp; The tower,
almost three hundred feet in height, is built of dark-red stone,
with the alternating raised and sunk patterns (called in Spanish
Ajaracas) cut deeply or standing boldly out from the solid
masonry.&nbsp; At one time tile work filled most of the patterns,
or was embroidered round the edges of the windows, but neglect
and time have made most of it drop away.&nbsp; Still, just below
the parapet runs a broad band, which from the square appears to
be full four feet broad, of the most wonderful black and green <a
name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 266</span>hidescent
tiles I ever saw.&nbsp; When Fabir, who, tradition says, built it
for the Sultan El Mansur, and it stood glorious, adorned with
tiles like those which still remain, the gilding fresh upon the
great brass balls, even the mosque at Cordoba itself could not
have been more glorious, and El Mansur could not have easily
foreseen that on his lonely tomb under the palm trees, beside the
river at Rabat, goats would browse and shepherds play their
pipes.&nbsp; Allah, Jehovah, all the Gods are alike unmindful of
their worshippers, who made and gave them fame; what more may the
contrivers of the Crystal Palace and the gasometers at Battersea
expect, when they have had their day?&nbsp; Medina, Mellah,
Kaiserieh, Sidi Bel Abbas, the tomb of Mulai Abdul Azis, all have
been described so many times and by such serious and painstaking
writers, who have apparently measured, re-measured, and
calculated the cubic capacity of every building in Morocco city,
that it would have been a work of supererogation on my part to
have laid a measuring tape once more on any of them.</p>
<p>Morocco city struck me, and has always done so, for I have
been there twice, as the best example of a purely African city I
have seen.&nbsp; Fez has the mixture of Spanish blood in its
inhabitants which the expulsed from Malaga, Granada, and from all
the Andalos, brought and disseminated.&nbsp; In the high houses,
which make the streets like sewers to walk in, you hear men play
the lute, and women sing the Malague&ntilde;a, Ca&ntilde;a and
the Ronde&ntilde;a as in mountain towns in Spain.&nbsp; Quite
half the population have fair hair, some pale blue eyes, and
their fanaticism is born of ancient persecution by the fanatic
Christians of Spain.&nbsp; In every house, in every mosque, in
almost every saint&rsquo;s tomb is fine tile work, stone and wood
carving, the eaves especially being often as richly decorated as
they had been Venetian and not African.&nbsp; The streets are <a
name="page267"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 267</span>thronged,
men move quickly through them and the whole place is redolent of
aristocracy, of a great religious class, in fact has all the air
of what in Europe we call a capital.</p>
<p>Morocco city is purely African, negroes abound; the streets
are never full, even in the kaiserieh <a
name="citation267"></a><a href="#footnote267"
class="citation">[267]</a> you can make your way about.&nbsp;
With the exception of the Kutubieh Tower, and some fine
fountains, notably that with the inscription &ldquo;Drink and
admire&rdquo; (<i>Shrab-u-Schuf</i>) inscribed upon it, and the
fine gate of the Kasbah of the best period of Moorish work, there
is no architecture.&nbsp; Sand, sand, and more sand in almost
every street, in the vast open spaces, in the long winding narrow
lanes, outside the walls up to the city gates; sand in your hair,
your clothes, the coats of animals.&nbsp; Streets, streets, and
still more streets of houses in decay.&nbsp; Yellow adobe walls,
dazzling white roofs and dense metallic semi-tropical vegetation
shrouding the heaps of yellowish decaying masonry.&nbsp; No
noise, the footfalls of the mules and camels falling into the
sand as rain falls into the sea, with a soft swishing sound.</p>
<p>The people all are African, men from the Draa, the Sus, the
Sahara, Wad Nun and the mysterious sandy steppes below Cape
Bojador.&nbsp; Arabs are quite in the minority, and the fine
types and full grey beards of aged Sheikhs one sees so frequently
in Fez exchanged for the spare Saharowi type, or the shaved lip
and cheeks and pointed chin tufts of the Berber race.&nbsp;
Tom-tom and gimbry are their chief instruments, together with the
Moorish flute, ear-piercing and encouraging to horses, who when
they hear its shriek, step proudly, arching their necks and
moving sideways down the streets as if they liked the
sound.&nbsp; Their songs are African, the interval so strange,
and <a name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 268</span>the
rhythm so unlike that of all European music, as at first hearing
to be almost unintelligible; but which at last grow on one until
one likes them and endeavours to repeat their tunes.&nbsp; Hardly
an aristocratic family lives in the place, and few Sherifs, the
richer of the population being traders with the Sahara.</p>
<p>A city of vast distances, immense perspectives, great desolate
squares, of gardens miles in length, a place in which you want a
mule to ride about, for to attempt to labour through the sand on
foot would be a purgatory.&nbsp; And yet a place which grows upon
you, the sound of water ever in your ears, the narrow streets
arched over all with grape vines; mouth of the Sahara, city of
Yusuf-ibn-Tachfin, town circled in with mountains, plain girt,
sun beaten, wind swept, ruinous, wearisome, and mournful in the
sad sunlight which enshrouds its mouldering walls.</p>
<p>Fez and Rabat, Sefrou, Salee and Mogador with Tetuan, Larache,
Dar-el-Baida and the rest may have more trade, more art, more
beauty, population, importance, industry, rank, faith,
architecture, or what you will; but none of them enter into your
soul as does this heap of ruins, this sandheap, desert town,
metropolis of the fantastic world which stretches from its walls
across the mountains through the oases of the Sahara; and which
for aught I know may some day have its railway station, public
houses, Salvation Army barracks, and its people have their eyes
opened, as were those of Adam and of Eve, and veil their
nakedness in mackintoshes.&nbsp; Through streets and open spaces,
past mosque doors, with glimpses of the worshippers at prayers
seated upon the floor, or lounging in the inner courts, through
streets arched in with vines, the trellis work so low that upon
horseback one had to bend one&rsquo;s head in passing, and at the
side door of the missionary&rsquo;s house (Dar-Ebikouros) I got
off, and, sending up a boy, was met <a name="page269"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 269</span>by Mr. Nairn, who for a moment did
not recognise me dressed in the Moorish clothes.&nbsp; There, as
upon my first visit to Morocco city, I received a hospitable and
courteous welcome.&nbsp; Long we sat talking of our
captivity.&nbsp; I learned about the hurried visit of the Oudad
with letters, his departure without a word, and found that no one
had expected us so soon.&nbsp; Mr. Nairn, who spoke both Arabic
and Shillah well, had passed on one occasion close to Kintafi;
but, not having been near the castle, was not recognised, but
like myself had been unable to push on to Tarudant.&nbsp; This in
a measure consoled me for my failure, as Mr. Nairn had lived long
in the country, spoke the language well, and with his dark
complexion and black hair, dressed in the Moorish clothes, must
have looked exactly like a Berber mountaineer.&nbsp; After a
welcome and most necessary bath I left his hospitable house and
rode to Sid Abu Beckr&rsquo;s, almost the only man in Morocco
city from whom it is possible for a European to get a
house.&nbsp; And, as I rode, I mused upon the mystery of faith,
and marvelled to see the honest single-hearted missionary still
with the cross upon his shoulders, ploughing the stony vineyard
of the Moorish heart, quite as contentedly and just as hopefully
as he had done four years ago.&nbsp; Yet, not a ray of hope,
without a convert or a chance of making one, and still contented,
hoping for the time when he should see the fruit of his hard
work.&nbsp; Crowds thronged his courtyard in the morning to get
medicines, and I fancy as he dispensed his drugs, in the goodness
of his heart he tried to do all that was in his power to lead his
patients to what he thought the truth.&nbsp; Women in numbers
came, not for the medicines, so much as for the bottles, which
they valued highly to keep oil for cooking in, throwing the
medicine carefully away; but cherishing the flask and bearing it
about them always, slung in a little case.&nbsp; Bottles <a
name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 270</span>may yet
save souls when preaching fails, for women who receive them may
so work upon their husbands&rsquo; hearts, that by degrees, from
the errors of Mohammed and the mere two ounce phial, they rise to
the imperial pint and Christianity; and so societies at home
should send more bottles out, artfully coloured and with the
necks fashioned to hold a string, so that if bibles prove of no
effect, bottles may yet prevail.</p>
<p>Not that I mean to undervalue missionaries, they have their
uses, but in a different way from that in which perchance they
think themselves.&nbsp; What they can do is to set forth, in
countries like Morocco, that they are not mere merchants trying
to deceive all those with whom they deal.&nbsp; So in Morocco
city Mr. Nairn and his wife, and the young men and women of his
household, have the respect of all the Moors for the pureness of
their life, and their untiring kindness to the poor.&nbsp; The
educated Moors see that they are like their own religious
sects&mdash;that is, their minds are fixed, not upon gain, but
prayer, and in the East madness and holiness are held akin, and
both, as being sent from heaven, are respected.</p>
<p>In a few hundred yards I left all holiness behind, and getting
off at Abu Beckr&rsquo;s door, found that astute and clever
politician seated as usual at the receipt of custom, counting
some money which he had just received, a pistol by his side and a
large iron box wide open by him in which to store the gold.</p>
<p>Sid Abu Beckr el Ghanjaui is known from the Atlas to the Riff,
and from the Sahara to Mogador, feared and disliked, and yet
respected, for the Moor above all other things respects
success.&nbsp; Not that, by any means, he thinks the less of
those who fail.&nbsp; Success and failure are both sent by God,
they were ordained (Mektub), and the mere man is but the
instrument of Allah&rsquo;s will.&nbsp; For the last thirty years
Sid Abu Beckr has been the British agent in Morocco.&nbsp; During
that <a name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
271</span>time he has made many enemies, as any man of ability
placed in his position could not fail to do.&nbsp; Of obscure
origin and deeply tinged with negro blood, he is, perhaps, to-day
the richest and the ablest man in the whole country.&nbsp; Few
men in any land have been the victims of more calumnies, but, on
the other hand, few men have had more friends.&nbsp; To some, a
slave dealer, a traitor, spy, and perjured sycophant; to others,
a true friend of England, a man who has suffered much for his
devotion to her cause.&nbsp; To me, a clever, scheming
politician, who has known the right way in which to play upon the
weaknesses of a long series of Ambassadors.&nbsp; A friend to
England without doubt, as thrasher is to sword-fish when they
attack a whale.&nbsp; A true &ldquo;faux maigre&rdquo;; a thin
yet flabby man, scant bearded like a eunuch, reedy voiced, and in
complexion atrabilious; his shoulders bent, eyes with spots on
the yellowish whites, and pupils like a cat&rsquo;s; slight
nervous hands, persuasive manners, and, in fact, one who
impresses you at first sight as a keen intellect confined in a
mean envelope; but yet not despicable.</p>
<p>Not what is called an educated Moor, still less of the Moorish
upper classes by his birth, he yet to-day has as much power in
Morocco as any man outside the circle of the court.&nbsp; He says
he speaks no English, though I think he understands it, but he
takes care to conceal such knowledge of it as he may have, so
that in speaking to him, those who speak no Arabic, speaking
through an interpreter, may give him ample time for the
consideration of every word he says.&nbsp; Never for a moment to
be caught off his guard or disconcerted, for the story goes that
once, during an ambassadorial visit, a slave dealer came with
some merchandise, and that, in answer to the query of the
Ambassador if those were slaves, Beckr replied they were, but, as
he was an English subject, when they entered through his doors
they became free at once.</p>
<p><a name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 272</span>For
some reason, not perfectly explained, the Nonconformist
conscience, some years ago, was greatly exercised about the
man.&nbsp; All that was infamous was put down to his
charge.&nbsp; He was a slave-dealer, a brothel keeper, I think a
murderer, and, of course, an adulterer, that being the crime the
&ldquo;Conscience Bearers&rdquo; detested most, being shut out
from all participation by the exigencies of their life.&nbsp; All
went on merrily as things are apt to go in England when the
accused is a good long way off: questions were asked in
Parliament as to why England countenanced such a man as Abu Beckr
in a position of high confidence.&nbsp; Ministers answered what
was put into their heads, having no inkling of who Abu Beckr was,
or what had raised the storm.&nbsp; As there was after all no
money in the matter, the questioners gradually tailed off.&nbsp;
Then Abu Beckr brought an action in the court in Gibraltar, and
explained how it was he had been charged with the commission of
so many crimes.&nbsp; It turned out that being a Moor he
certainly had slaves, and even bought and sold them as we do
horses; but as such was the everyday custom of the land, and he,
when he took British protection, had not become a Wesleyan
Methodist, where was the harm in it?&nbsp; As to the second
charge, he had, of course, four wives, and no doubt many women in
his house, but, as he pertinently said, that his religion allowed
him, and as far as he knew yet, he had not changed his
faith.&nbsp; So he triumphantly floored his antagonists, got
damages, received eventually a silver tea service from the
British Government, and retired to his home to laugh at every one
concerned.</p>
<p>Abu Beckr, though he knew I had arrived in town, most likely
took me for a Moor from Fez, between whom and the people of
Morocco city little love is lost, for somewhat roughly he asked
me what I wanted, and did not offer me a seat.&nbsp; I listened
to <a name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 273</span>him
for a moment, and watched his cunning diplomatic smile, as he
looked at me from the corner of his eyes to find out who I
was.&nbsp; Then I said in English, &ldquo;Good morning, Sidi
Beckr&rdquo;; and he laughed and said he had known me all the
time, but wanted to see what kind of Arabic I spoke.&nbsp; As he
had only seen me once before some years ago, and dressed in
European clothes, I only smiled, and said my Arabic was worse
than ever, and that I wanted him to lend me some house in which
to rest my servants and myself.</p>
<p>A man was brought to accompany us to an empty house hard by;
he bore a monstrous key, and after leading us through several
narrow streets, stopped at a brand new house, and throwing the
door wide open said it was fit for any king, and that he
generally received five dollars upon Abu Beckr&rsquo;s account
for opening the door.&nbsp; I told him instantly that I should
mention to his master what he said, then took the key out of his
hand, gave him a dollar, and asked Lutaif to tell him to what
place the Koran condemns all those who palter with the
truth.&nbsp; The usual scrubbing and swilling out took place,
which always has to be undertaken before it is possible to occupy
an empty Moorish house.&nbsp; Once swilled and dried, we
installed our scanty property, sent out for food, put up our
horses in a fondak not far off, and fell asleep upon the
floor.&nbsp; Upon awakening we found the dinner beside us, and a
negro squatting, and patiently watching till we should awake.</p>
<p>During the interval, Swani and Mohammed-el-Hosein had both
gone to the bath, and then I fancy, after the fashion of all
sailors and muleteers after a voyage or trip, gone on the spree,
for in the morning they appeared like Mr. Henley&rsquo;s
&ldquo;rakehell cat,&rdquo; looking a little draggled, and the
worse for wear, and swearing that they had not touched a drop of
drink.&nbsp; The patient Ali never stirred away, being, as he
said, <a name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
274</span>rather afraid to venture out alone amongst the people
in the crowded streets.&nbsp; After a journey in Morocco the men
always ask for new shoes, so to show my disgust at the immoral
conduct of the others, I took Ali out and made him happy with a
pair of evil-smelling yellow leather shoes, adding a pair of
gorgeously embroidered orange-coloured slippers for his
House.</p>
<p>A dirty little negro boy came to inform us that Sidi Abu Beckr
expected us to dine that afternoon at two o&rsquo;clock, the
fashionable hour in the Sherifian capital.</p>
<p>During the interval I walked about the streets, pleased that
the Moorish clothes relieved me from the attentions to which I
had been subjected on my former visit to the place.&nbsp; Through
the interminable streets I strolled, past ruined fountains and
the doors of mosques half opened, from whose interiors came a
sound of prayer, as from the beehive comes the murmured prayer of
bees.&nbsp; Long trains of camels pressed me into corners to
escape their snakelike heads, and suddenly, and without
consciousness of how I got there, I found myself in a remembered
spot.&nbsp; A little alley paved with cobble-stones and bordered
on each side with open shops, in which sat squatted white figures
working hand looms which filled the alley with their clack.&nbsp;
At the end an archway with a wooden gate hanging ajar.&nbsp; I
entered it with a strange feeling of possession, and found
everything familiar; the tank, with edges of red stucco work, the
Azofaifa <a name="citation274"></a><a href="#footnote274"
class="citation">[274]</a> trees, the bordering hedge of myrtle,
the white datura, the curiously cut semi-Italian flower beds, in
which grew marjoram and thyme, the open baldachino at the end,
under whose leaky roof a friend and I had spread our rugs and
spent ten happy days four years ago, smoking, lounging about, and
talking <a name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
275</span>endlessly of nothing, as only friends can talk, was all
unchanged.&nbsp; What are four years of inattention beside the
perennial decay of all things Eastern; the winter rain and summer
sun had scarcely put an extra stain or two upon the plaster work,
the door was made to last for ages, and the trees had but become
a little more luxuriant; so, sitting down, I smoked and fell
a-musing on the time when in Morocco all would be changed, and
places like the Riad <a name="citation275a"></a><a
href="#footnote275a" class="citation">[275a]</a> el Hamri, where
I then sat, exist no more.&nbsp; Railway engines (praise him who
giveth wisdom to mankind) would puff and snort, men hurry to and
fro, tramways and bicycles make life full and more glorious;
women unveiled would sell themselves after the Christian way for
drink and gold; men lie drunk on holidays to show their freedom
from debasing superstition; all would be changed; the scent of
camels&rsquo; dung give place to that of coal dust; and perhaps
Allah, after regarding with complacency the work of man, would
rest contented as he did in Eden when his first masterpieces
forced his hand.</p>
<p>Sid Abu Beckr met us in the courtyard of his house, dressed in
a light green robe, spotless white haik, <a
name="citation275b"></a><a href="#footnote275b"
class="citation">[275b]</a> new yellow slippers, with a large
rosary in his hand, although the oldest citizen of Marakesh had
never seen him pray.&nbsp; Leading me courteously by the hand
into an upper chamber looking upon a courtyard, and decorated in
the purest modern Alhambraesque, he seated me, Lutaif, and then
himself, on cushions, and we ate solidly for a full hour, until
the welcome sight of tea, served in small gold cups, announced
our sufferings were at an end.</p>
<p>Nothing would get out of his head at first that I was not an
agent of the Globe Venture Syndicate, or <a
name="page276"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 276</span>had a
mission from the British Government to try and establish some
sort of undertaking with the chiefs of Sus.&nbsp; His
apprehensions set at rest, or at the least so he pretended, he,
too, began to give his views upon the state of current
politics.&nbsp; All that the Sherif of Tamasluoght had said he
quite corroborated, but with the difference that what he said was
the opinion of a quick-witted, clever man, and therefore, to my
mind, to some extent brought less conviction than the mere
wanderings of the artless &ldquo;saint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Most Arabs of the richer class are quite incapable of seeing
anything but from a personal standpoint, and thus it is that, bit
by bit, their national power has fallen into decay.&nbsp; In
Spain, Damascus, Tunis, and the Morocco of to-day chiefs have
arisen, and their sole idea has been to push their individual
fortunes.&nbsp; Except the Emir Abd-el-Kader, none have had even
a glimpse of trying to restore the Arab power.</p>
<p>So Abu Beckr regaled us with stories of Ba Ahmed&rsquo;s
villainy, his own position and personal insecurity, and assured
me that the end was near, and that if England still stood
hesitating, France would step in, and lastly, getting for a
moment out of his egotism, said, &ldquo;What avails it that I am
so rich when my favourite son died of smallpox only three weeks
ago, and I have no one to whom to leave my wealth?&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then he got up and said he had never showed his wealth to anyone,
but as he found me so sympathetic to his views (I not having said
a word), he would show me all his treasures and his house.&nbsp;
Accordingly, we followed him into an interior court, on one side
of which a door with about twenty padlocks stood.</p>
<p>Sidi Abu Beckr having assured himself that no one but
ourselves was looking on, began to clash and bang amongst the
locks and bars, piling the padlocks on the ground, unloosening
chains, and making as much noise as a battle of armour-plated
knights must <a name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
277</span>have produced in the never-to-be-forgotten days of
chivalry, when, in their mail, the scrofulous champions tapped on
one another&rsquo;s shields.&nbsp; At last the door swung open
and disclosed a room packed full of boxes, silver dessert
services, china of all sorts, lamps, clocks, and every kind of
miscellaneous wealth collected in the long course of an
honourable career by strict attention to all economic laws.&nbsp;
Boxes were there of iron painted in colours, made in Holland and
in Spain, standing beside hide cases, teak chests, and old
portmanteaux, Saratoga trunks and safes, cash boxes, sea chests,
and packing cases, and all apparently stuffed to the very
lids.&nbsp; With pardonable pride, and with a flush stealing upon
his parchment cheek, he did obeisance to his gods.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This is all silver Spanish dollars, this Sultan
Hassan&rsquo;s coins, this packing case is jewellery.&nbsp; I had
it all in pledge.&nbsp; This, silver in the bar, and these hide
bags are gold dust, but the king of all,&rdquo; and here he
touched an antiquated safe, &ldquo;is el d&rsquo;hab (gold),
chiefly in sovereigns.&nbsp; Yes, I know the waste of interest,
but do not think you see half of all my wealth; the bulk of it is
safely placed in England&mdash;consols, I think they call
it&mdash;safe, but small returns, and smaller since the accursed
Goschen lowered the rate.&nbsp; This that you see I keep beside
me, partly from caprice, for el d&rsquo;hab has always been my
passion, passing the love of women, horses, or of anything that
God has made to ease the life of man.&rdquo;&nbsp; As he spoke he
patted the safe with his slippered feet, and looked as if he knew
a special providence watched over him; but knowing did not
truckle to the power, but rather took it as a tribute to himself
and his ability, as being well assured that providence is always
with the strong.&nbsp; As I looked at him, proud of his wealth,
his cunning and his good fortune, it seemed as if our nation,
with its power, its riches, and its insensibility, was fitly <a
name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 278</span>represented
by the worthy man, who, from a camel driver&rsquo;s state, by the
sheer force of industry and thrift, had made his fortune.</p>
<p>Blessed are those who rise, to them the world is pleasant and
well ordered, all things are right, and virtue is rewarded (in
themselves); thrice blessed are the pachydermatous of heart, the
deaf of soul, the invertebrate, insensible, the unimaginative;
nothing can injure, nothing wound them; nature&rsquo;s injustice,
man&rsquo;s ineptitude, fortune&rsquo;s black joking, leaves them
as untouched as a blind cart-horse, who, in struggling up a hill,
sets his sharp, calkered foot upon a mouse.&nbsp; But as mankind,
in strangeness and variety of mind, is quite incomprehensible,
Sidi Abu Beckr had but hardly locked the door upon his hoards
than he set to bewail his sonless state.&nbsp; &ldquo;Allah has
given me children (so he said), sons, grown to men&rsquo;s
estate, but all unprofitable, idle and profligate, and of those
who spend their time in folly, all but one, a boy to whom I hoped
to leave my wealth.&nbsp; All that you see was to be his, the
silver, gold, this house, my lands, investments in your country,
all I have, and as I thought that Abu Beckr had not lived in
vain, the pestilence fell on my house and left me poorer than
when I was a camel driver; but it was written; God the most
merciful, the compassionate, the inscrutable, he alone giveth
life, and sends his death to men.&nbsp; Come let me show you
where my blessing died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lutaif, who, since the word smallpox had first been mentioned,
had held his handkerchief up to his nose, now for the first time
in the journey almost broke into revolt.&nbsp; Pulling my
&ldquo;selham,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;Let us go, the
infectious microbes stand on no ceremony,&rdquo; and, in fact,
wished to retreat at once.&nbsp; Not from superior bravery, but
because I knew if there was mischief it was already done, I
laughed at all his fears, told him to trust providence, as a good
man <a name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
279</span>should do, and that for microbes, probably by this time
a new school of scientific men said they were non-existent, and
put down all diseases to some other cause.&nbsp; Seeing he got no
sympathy from me and perhaps after prayer (prayers, idle prayers)
he followed, and Abu Beckr conducted us to a room and opened wide
the door.&nbsp; Within, piled up upon the floor were heaps of
rugs, and evidently no window had been open for a month.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Here (he said) died my son, and nothing has been touched
since he was buried; upon this very rug he breathed his
last.&rdquo;&nbsp; And as he spoke, he lifted up a carpet from
the Sahara, woven in blue and red, and moved it to and fro so
that the microbes, if there were any, must have had fair play to
do their work.&nbsp; Lutaif turned pale, and once more pleaded to
be off; but Abu Beckr was inexorable and putting down the rug,
led us again through a long passage and opening yet another door,
said, &ldquo;Here the mother died, and nothing has been altered
since her death.&rdquo;&nbsp; At last Lutaif grew desperate and
seeing there was no escape began to grow at ease and followed us
through countless passages, peeping into rooms in each of which
some member of the family had died.</p>
<p>On our return to the alcove, where tea awaited us, we passed a
figure swathed in white which turned aside to let us pass, its
face against the wall.&nbsp; Abu Beckr took it by the hand and
introduced it as the mother of the dead boy&rsquo;s mother, and a
hand wrapped in a corner of a veil stole out, and for a moment
just touched mine, but all the time the eyes were fixed upon the
ground, after the style of Arab manners, which ordains that a
woman must not look a strange man in the face.&nbsp; Something
was mumbled in the nature of a complimentary phrase and then the
sheeted figure slipped mysteriously away, but no doubt turned to
look at the strange animals through some grating in the wall.</p>
<p><a name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
280</span>Lutaif explained that the honour done us was
remarkable, and that no doubt Abu Beckr had stopped her to show
how free from prejudice he was.&nbsp; The visit ended with more
tea and a long talk, in which again I was assured the end was
near, and that the Grand Vizir had made the life of every one
intolerable, ruined the land, rendered the Sultan despicable, and
that all educated men longed for the advent of some European
power.&nbsp; Having heard the same tale from the Sherif of
Tamasluoght, and as I knew both he and Abu Beckr were rich men
and above all things feared attacks upon their wealth, I mentally
resolved to talk the matter over with some Arab of the old school
and hear his views.</p>
<p>Standing before the door, we found a soldier with a lantern
waiting to see us home.&nbsp; We bid farewell to Abu Beckr,
watching him stand beneath the archway of his house in his green
robe and white burnouse, looking a figure out of the pages of the
&ldquo;Arabian Nights&rdquo;; but with a scheming brain and
subtle mind, able to hold his own with trained diplomatists and
to defeat them with the natural craft implanted in him by a wise
providence which arms the weak with lies, makes the strong
brutal, and is apparently content to watch the struggle, after
the fashion of an English tourist gloating upon a Spanish bull
fight on a fine Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>After a two days&rsquo; stay, with mules and horses well fed,
I left the city, passed through the battlemented gates, and saw
the walls, the gardens, palm trees, towers, and last of all the
Kutubieh sink out of sight, then set my face westward to cross
the hundred and thirty miles of stony plain which stretches
almost to Mogador.&nbsp; After the first day&rsquo;s ride, our
animals showed signs of giving out, the starving at
Thelata-el-Jacoub having reduced them so much in condition that
the two days&rsquo; rest had done but little good.&nbsp; <a
name="page281"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 281</span>Those who
have ridden tired horses, through stony wastes heated to boiling
point by the sun&rsquo;s rays, and without chance of finding
water on the road, can estimate the pleasure of our ride.&nbsp;
On the third day, just about noon, and after toiling painfully at
a slow walk through interminable fields of stone, we reached the
Zowia of Sidi-el-Mokhtar, where a portion of the tribe
Ulad-el-Bousbaa (the sons of Lions) were established, the other
portions of the tribe being respectively in Algeria and in the
Sahara.</p>
<p>Nothing could possibly have been more desert-like than the
surroundings of this tribe.&nbsp; On every side stones, stones,
and still more stones.&nbsp; For vegetation thorny Zizyphus, hard
wiry grass, stunted euphorbiace&aelig;, with colocynths growing
here and there between the stones; a palm-tree at the well, and a
gnarled sandarac tree, looking as if it had never known a shower,
with the leaves as hard as pine needles, stood like a sentinel
defying thirst.&nbsp; The Zowia itself seemed even more Eastern
than most buildings of its kind, the walls merely baked mud, the
towers but hardly overtopping them, and all the animals of a
superior class to those raised by the ordinary Moors.&nbsp; The
tribe ranks high for fighting qualities, as riders, shots, and
swordsmen, and though small, can hold its own against all
comers.&nbsp; The women, taller and thinner than the women of the
Moors, were dressed in blue, after the desert fashion, and in
procession walked to the well, with each one carrying an amphora
upon her head.</p>
<p>The Sheikh, a Saharan Sherif, by name Mulai Othmar, was the
best specimen of a high-caste Arab I had ever seen.&nbsp; Tall
and broad-shouldered, lean and tanned by the sun to a fine tinge
of old mahogany, grave and reserved, but courteous.&nbsp; Arabia
itself could have produced no finer type of man.&nbsp; He asked
us to dismount, put corn before our beasts, and sent a dish <a
name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 282</span>of
couscousou for ourselves, sat and conversed, drank tea, but would
not smoke, saying to smoke was shameful, but all the same he was
not able to forbear to ask if tobacco was as strong as
kief.&nbsp; Strength being the first object to an Arab, he not
unnaturally believed that as our powder far exceeded theirs, so
did tobacco far exceed their kief in strength, and seemed a
little disappointed when I told him kief was stronger far than
any cigarette.</p>
<p>During the two hot hours of noon, whilst the south wind blew
like a blast out of a furnace, we squatted underneath the Zowia
wall, shifting about to dodge the sun, as it moved westwards, and
the Sherif stayed talking with us, as befits a man of
blood.&nbsp; Though simply dressed in clean white clothes, he
looked a prince, and all our men saluted him with ten times more
respect than they had used towards either Abu Beckr or the Sherif
of Tamasluoght.&nbsp; Much he imparted of the Sahara, its lore,
traditions, told of the &ldquo;wind drinkers,&rdquo; <a
name="citation282a"></a><a href="#footnote282a"
class="citation">[282a]</a> who, in the ostrich hunts, carry
their masters a hundred miles a day.&nbsp; Much did he tell us of
the Tuaregs, who, being Berbers, are at constant feud with all
the Arab tribes.&nbsp; In the Sahara no money circulated, but a
good mare was bought for forty camels or two hundred sheep; guns
came from Dakar, or St. Louis Senegal, and were called either
&ldquo;Francis,&rdquo; or else &ldquo;Mocatta,&rdquo; though he
could give no explanation of the latter term.&nbsp; Beyond San
Louis was situate the mysterious Ben Joul, <a
name="citation282b"></a><a href="#footnote282b"
class="citation">[282b]</a> to which place he said the Inglis
came, a nation at eternal enmity with the Francis, fair in
complexion, and addicted to strong drink, but pleasant to deal
with, and in business having but one word.</p>
<p>Morocco seemed to him too green and overgrown <a
name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 283</span>with
vegetation, so that a man grew dazzled when he looked at
it.&nbsp; He thought no landscape half so fine as a long stretch
of sand, flat and depressionless as is the sea, and with a
stunted sandarac here and there, a few rare suddra bushes, and in
the distance, an oasis, green as an emerald, with its wells, its
melon fields, and clustering date palms, with their roots in
water, <a name="citation283"></a><a href="#footnote283"
class="citation">[283]</a> and feathery branches in the fire of
the sun.&nbsp; No friend of French or English intervention was
the Sherif Mulai Othmar; but a believer in the regeneration of
the Moors, by a new intermixture of the desert blood which in
times past has often been the salvation of the Arab race.&nbsp;
From what he said the ancient Arab manners must have been
preserved in all their purity in the Sahara, and, but for the
introduction of villainous saltpetre, differ but little in
essentials from a thousand years ago.</p>
<p>The low black tents of camels&rsquo; hair, the wandering life,
the little Arab saddles, used to-day in Syria and in Arabia, and
differing widely from the high-peaked saddle of Morocco, the
finer breed of horses, and, above all, the pure speech of the
Koreish not mixed with Spanish and with Berber words as is the
Arabic of the Morocco Moors, all show the great tenacity with
which the desert tribes have clung to usages and to traditions
hallowed by custom and by time.&nbsp; Finding the Sherif spoke
such good Arabic, Lutaif and I agreed to refer to his decision a
question of literary interest which had engrossed us for the past
few days.&nbsp; A controversy at the time was raging in Morocco
amongst the men of letters, as to whether the word <i>Mektub</i>
(&ldquo;It is written&rdquo;) might not be spelt
&ldquo;Mektab.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Much had been written, as is usual in such cases, on either
side, old friends had quarrelled, and each side looked upon the
other as people of no culture and <a name="page284"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 284</span>outside the pale of decent
men.&nbsp; My preference was for &ldquo;Mektub,&rdquo; but
Lutaif, who had the prejudice which knowledge of a language
sometimes induces, was in favour of &ldquo;Mektab.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The Sherif considered carefully, and gave his dictum that either
could be said, although he added, those who say
&ldquo;Mektab&rdquo; show want of education.&nbsp; So we were
left in the position of the grammarian, whose last words were,
&ldquo;l&rsquo;un et l&rsquo;autre se disent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus, in a week, I had met three Arabs all representative of
their several classes, and, as usual, liked the man best who had
been least influenced by European ways.&nbsp; Mulai Othmar
disdained the idea of European protection, saying it was fit for
Jews and slaves, but not for men, and that, for his part, sooner
than ask for protection from any European power, he would return
into the desert and follow a nomadic life.&nbsp; I took my leave
of him with a feeling of real regret, such as one feels
occasionally for those one sees but for an instant, but whose
features never leave one&rsquo;s mind.&nbsp; If there are, in the
Sahara, many such as he, there is regeneration yet for the Arab
race, so that they resolutely refuse all dealings with Europeans;
reject our bibles, guns, powder, and shoddy cottons, our
political intrigues, and strive to live after the rules their
Prophet left them in his holy book.&nbsp; If they forsake them,
as in some measure the inhabitants of Morocco certainly have
done, slavery, sure and certain, is their lot; and in the time to
come our rule, or that of the French or Germans, will transform
them into the semblance of the abject creatures who once were
free as swallows, and who to-day lounge round the frontier towns
in North America calling themselves Utes, Blackfeet, Apaches, or
what not, ghosts of their former selves, sodden with whisky,
blotched with the filthy ailments we have introduced, and living
contradictions of the morality and the religion under which we
live.</p>
<p><a name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 285</span>By
noon next day we had almost dropped the Atlas out of sight; the
enormous wall of rocks rising straight from the plain had
vanished; the tall snow-peaks above the chain alone remained in
sight, and they appeared to hang suspended in the air.&nbsp; The
vegetation changed, and once again the ground grew sandy.&nbsp;
The white <a name="citation285"></a><a href="#footnote285"
class="citation">[285]</a> broom bursting into flower covered it
here and there in patches, as with an air of snow new fallen and
congealed upon the branches of the plants.&nbsp; Again we passed
a range of foothills, rocky and steep, from the top of which,
like a blue vapoury haze, we saw the sea; and as we led our jaded
animals down the abrupt descent, a Berber shepherd standing on a
knoll was playing on his pipe.&nbsp; He stopped occasionally and
burst into a strange, wild song, quavering and fitful, the rhythm
interrupted curiously, so as to be almost incomprehensible to
ears accustomed to street organs, pianos, bands, sackbut, harp,
psaltery, and all kinds of music which we have fashioned and take
delight in according to our kind; but which I take it would be as
void of meaning to a Berber as is our way of life.&nbsp; I
checked my horse, and sitting sideways for an instant, tried to
catch the rhythm; but failed, perhaps because my ears were dulled
by all the noises of our world, and less attuned to nature than
those of the brown figure standing on the rock.&nbsp; But though
I could not catch that which I aimed at, I still had pleasure in
his song, for, as he sang, the noise of trains and omnibuses
faded away; the smoky towns grew fainter; the rush, the hurry,
and the commonness of modern life sank out of sight; and in their
place I saw again the valley of the N&rsquo;fiss, the giant
Kasbah with its four truncated towers, the Kaid, his wounded
horse, the Persian, and the strange entrancing half-feudal,
half-Arcadian life, which to have seen but for a fortnight
consoled <a name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
286</span>me for my failure, and will remain with me a constant
vision (seen in the mind, of course, as ghosts are seen); but
ever fresh and unforgettable.</p>
<p>Next day about eleven o&rsquo;clock, driving our horses
through the Argan scrub in front of us, tired, dusty, and on
foot, we reached the Palm-Tree House.</p>

287</span>APPENDIX A<br />
&ldquo;SOME OBSERVATIONS ON THE SHILLAH LANGUAGE.&rdquo;</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Shillah tongue, that is, the
speech of the southern branch of the great Berber family, since
1799, when Venture de Paradis made his vocabulary, has greatly
interested students of philology.&nbsp; Its great antiquity is
undoubted, the term Amazirgh by which the Shillah designate
themselves occurring in the pages of several classical writers
under the form of Mazyes, Mazisci, and Mazyes.&nbsp; Though akin
to the dialect spoken in the Riff mountains, and that of the
Kabyles of Algeria, and possessing considerable affinity to the
Tamashek spoken by the Tuaregs, it yet has considerable dialectic
differences from all of them, though they have been usually held
to be of one stock.&nbsp; The chief peculiarity that strikes a
stranger is the formation of the feminine in nouns which is
marked by the addition of a T at the beginning and the end of the
word, as Amazirgh (noble), which becomes Tamazirght, when used
for the speech of the Shillah people.&nbsp; Tarudant and Tafilet
are merely Arabic words turned into Shillah by the addition of
the two T&rsquo;s, and rendered feminine to agree with the Arabic
word Medina, a city.</p>
<p>The Shillah proper inhabit the whole range of the southern
Atlas, the province of Sus, with that of the Ha-ha, and extend
southward to the oasis of Tafilet, though there Arab and Shillah
(Berber) tribes live close beside each other.</p>
<p>Place-names to which the word Ait (<i>i.e.</i>, Ben or Mac) is
prefixed, as Ait-Usi, Ait-Atta, Ait-M&rsquo;tuga, etc., indicate
that the district is inhabited by a Berber tribe.</p>
<p>I subjoin a short list of words, written down whilst detained
in Kintafi, but without pretending to their absolute correctness,
as my knowledge of Arabic (our means of communication) is very
slight, and nothing is more difficult than to get uneducated men
to repeat words, familiar, and therefore easy to themselves,
several times over, so that a stranger may catch them.&nbsp; In
order to show the entire dissimilarity of the two languages, I
give the Arabic as well as the English equivalents.</p>

<p>The language is, to my ear, not so guttural, but more nasal
than the Arabic of Morocco.&nbsp; I think that a stranger,
ignorant of both languages, would acquire Shillah more easily
than Arabic.&nbsp; Like the Romany, or Calo, spoken in Spain,
Shillah has been greatly corrupted by an admixture of the
dominant tongue, so much so that the native verbs are largely
lost, and their use supplemented by verbs taken from Arabic.</p>
<p>In writing, the Shillah use the Arab <a
name="citation288"></a><a href="#footnote288"
class="citation">[288]</a> character, and as far as is known,
only one book, known as <i>El Maziri</i>, a compendium of the
observances and ceremonies of the Mohammedan religion, has been
written in the Shillah tongue.</p>
<p>The language abounds in the nasal gh, which may be rendered by
an extremely nasal r, but which, like the Arabic h (Ha), is
almost impossible to be learnt, except from someone acquainted
with the proper pronunciation, as no written directions explain
the peculiar sound.</p>
<p>Many treatises on Shillah, Kayble, and Tamashek, and their
differences and affinity, have appeared at different times,
chiefly in French.&nbsp; Perhaps the best is that of the Marquis
de Rochemontein, &ldquo;Essai sur les rapports grammaticaux entre
l&rsquo;Egyptien et le Berbere,&rdquo; Paris, 1876.&nbsp; Leo
Africanus also asserts the affinity of the two tongues.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Sir</span>&mdash;It appears that
like St. Paul I am destined to be in prisons oft.&nbsp; Whilst
endeavouring to cross the Atlas into the almost unknown province
of Sus, I was arrested by the Governor of this province on
October 19th, and have been detained here on various pretexts
ever since.&nbsp; To-night one of our followers is to gird up his
loins, tighten his turban, take his staff in his hand, pull up
the heels of his shoes, testify to the existence of the one God,
and strike across the hills to place this &lsquo;copy&rsquo; in
the hands of the British Vice-Consul at Mogador, about two
hundred miles away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Though we are civilly treated, our position is the
reverse of pleasant.&nbsp; We are allowed to walk about, but we
cannot go far from our tent, and we have no idea why we are
detained.&nbsp; I spare you any remarks on the flora and fauna of
the district, for Inshallah, I propose to inflict them on a
harmless and much book-ridden public.&nbsp; I merely state
briefly that this house, an immense castle built of mud, is
situated in an amphitheatre of hills, all capped with snow, and
that a brawling river, the Wad N&rsquo;fiss, runs past our tent;
goats wander in the hills, tended by boys wild as their
ancestors, whom Jugurtha led against the Romans.&nbsp; Horses and
mules are driven down to drink by negro slaves, prisoners clank
past in chains, knots of retainers <a name="page290"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 290</span>armed with six-foot guns stroll
about carelessly, pretending to guard the place; it is, in fact,
Arcadia grafted on feudalism, or feudalism steeped in
Arcadia.&nbsp; The call to prayers rises five times a day; Allah
looks down, and we sit smoking cigarettes, waiting for you to
turn your mighty lever on our behalf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For my companion in adversity I have a Syrian
Christian, who acts as my interpreter, and who writes this for
reasons known to you.&nbsp; Should Britain fail us, we hope that
that great prince, the Sultan Abdul Hamid (God hath given him the
victory), will send his fleet to our assistance, for, as we know,
each of his Christian subjects is as a portion of his heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things look a little serious, as we are quite uncertain
how long the Governor may keep us here.&nbsp; Therefore, I hope
that this may go into your best edition, and be the means of
making the Foreign Office act at once on our behalf, if we are
not released.</p>

<p>Having thus done all in my power to invoke the protection of
the Nonconformist Conscience (powerful amongst the noble Shillah
race) for myself, and that of his Sultan for Lutaif, I
recollected a business engagement, and wrote the following letter
to excuse myself for non-completion of contract.&nbsp; I have
ever held contracts as the most sacred of all the affairs of
life.</p>

be impossible for me to review the work called the <i>Canon</i>,

will place it in competent hands, for it is a well-written and
curious book.&nbsp; You know that, as a general rule, I am
reluctant to undertake reviewing, but in this case I should have
been glad to make an exception to my usual practice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before reviewing a book, I like to place a copy of it

prisoner in the Atlas Mountain, at the above address, and that
there seems no speedy prospect of my release.&nbsp; For details

<h2>APPENDIX C</h2>
<p>The following article appeared in the <i>Saturday Review</i>,
and may serve to show one of the elements of difficulty against
which I had to contend.&nbsp; Quite naturally, the country people
thought that I was a filibuster.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span class="smcap">The Voyage of
the</span> &ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Tourmaline</span>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The southern province of Morocco&mdash;that which extends from
Agadhir-Ighir to the Wad Nun&mdash;is called the Sus.&nbsp; Hanno
is said to mention it in his famed Periplus.&nbsp; The Romans
knew it vaguely.&nbsp; Suetonius may or may not refer to it when
he speaks of a rich province below the Atlas; but his work is
lost, and what remains comes down to us through Pliny, who
himself laments the Romans took so little trouble to explore the
coast.&nbsp; Polybius wrote of it; but what Polybius knew about
the Sus is left so vague, that renowned, grave, arm-chair
geographers have almost come to blows about it, as men of
literature have done as to the whereabouts of
Popering-at-the-Place.</p>
<p>Pliny certainly saw the lost writings of King Juba, and in
them he met the word Asana.&nbsp; This Asana is conjectured
(again by wise and reverend men) to have been
&ldquo;perhaps&rdquo; Akassa, the Berber name of the Wad
Nun.&nbsp; So that the ancients do not help us much to any
knowledge of the Sus.&nbsp; Marmol and Leo Africanus talk of the
province; but neither of them <a name="page292"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 292</span>saw it, though Leo penetrated to
Tamaglast, a village near Marakesh, supposed by some to be the
hamlet now called Fruga.&nbsp; Thus little was known about the
province, although travellers from Europe, as Arab writers tell
us, visited the capital Tarudant, coming by Agadhir, during the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, for purposes of trade.</p>
<p>All sorts of legends thus sprang up about the place: demons
inhabited it; a mountain spoke; magicians not a few lived near
the Wad Nun; La Caba, the daughter of Count Julian, who brought
the infidel to Spain, was buried in Tarudant, as the legend says;
and everything throughout North Africa, strange and miraculous,
occurred in Sus.&nbsp; Rich mines were there&mdash;gold, silver,
and &ldquo;diamont,&rdquo; iron, tin, and antimony, with
manganese and copper; the people were the most honest, wildest,
wisest, and most ferocious in the world; great ruined castles,
known to the natives as &ldquo;Kasbah el Rumi,&rdquo; were dotted
here and there, though who the &ldquo;Romans&rdquo; were no one
could tell, but probably they filled the place of the
&ldquo;Moros,&rdquo; who, as is well known, built all houses,
towers, and buildings, of whatever nature, which exceed a hundred
years in age throughout all Spain.</p>
<p>Coming to more modern times, in 1791, the Sultan sent to the
Governor of Gibraltar for a doctor to cure his son, at that time
governor in the province of the Sus.&nbsp; An Army surgeon called
Lempri&egrave;re was chosen, and, disembarking at Agadhir,
journeyed to Tarudant.&nbsp; As far as anything is known, he is
the first European who entered Tarudant since the sixteenth
century, when it is certain that merchants from Holland used to
journey to the annual fair.&nbsp; He crossed the Atlas from
Bibouan to Imintanout (by the same pass, in fact, which I
attempted in last October), and arrived in safety at
Mogador.&nbsp; He gives us little or no information about the
Sus, but vaguely speaks of mines, says that the country about
Tarudant was fertile and well cultivated, and describes the pass
he crossed as skirting along tremendous precipices, which, to my
certain knowledge, is not the case.</p>
<p>After him comes Jackson, who published his account of the
Empire of Morocco in 1809.&nbsp; Ball, in his appendix to
Hooker&rsquo;s &ldquo;Morocco and the Great Atlas,&rdquo; refers
to Jackson&rsquo;s book as being the most copious ever written
about the Sus.&nbsp; Certainly he had special advantages, for he
passed sixteen years in Mogador and Agadhir (now closed to
trade), spoke Arabic and Shillah, but all he says does not amount
to much.&nbsp; The map he made <a name="page293"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 293</span>Ball considers inferior to that of
Chenier, published a hundred years before his time.&nbsp; And so
of Admiral Washington, Gerhard Rohlfs, Gate11, and Oskar
Lenz.&nbsp; They all say little, for the good reason little is
known.&nbsp; Although the last three travellers passed through
the land, they went disguised, in terror of their lives, and are
believed to have known little or no Arabic.&nbsp; So that it
comes to this: All that we know with certainty is that a province
called the Sus exists, that it stretches from close to Agadhir to
the Wad Nun, a distance of some two hundred miles, with a varying
breadth of about seventy at the north, where it is bounded by the
Atlas mountains, the Wad Sus, and the province of the Ha-ha to a
hundred or more at the extreme south, as no one knows how far the
boundaries of the province stretch up the waters of the river
Nun.</p>
<p>Round about Agadhir the country has been visited, and is
reported to be very like the provinces of Shiadma and the Ha-ha,
which bound it to the north, that is, it is in general
configuration flat and sandy, with stretches here and there of
reddish argillaceous soil, but both soils greatly grown over with
thorny bushes, and here and there well cultivated.&nbsp;
Politically the province owns the Sultan of Morocco&rsquo;s sway,
but his authority extended lately but to Tarudant, the district
called Taserouelt, in which is situated the Zowia of Si Hamed
O&rsquo;Musa, now represented by Sidi Haschem, and to the great
Arab tribe of the Howara who occupy the country between Fonti and
Tarudant.&nbsp; Up to the banks of the Wad Nun, where there are
Arab tribes again (but wild and independent of the Sultan), most
of the inhabitants of the country are of the Berber race.&nbsp;
This race, the original inhabitants of the country before the
Arab conquest, has never been entirely conquered, and between
them and the Arab conquerors a strong enmity exists.</p>
<p>The chief trade of the province has always been with Mogador
since the port of Agadhir was closed by the great-grandfather of
the present Sultan.&nbsp; It consists of wool and camels&rsquo;
hair, goat-skins and hides, bees&rsquo; wax, a little gold dust,
ostrich feathers, gum-arabic, cattle and sheep, almonds, and all
the products of the Sahara, for most of the trade from the
western portion of that district comes to Mogador.&nbsp; In
return, they take Manchester goods, powder, tea, sugar, cheap
German cutlery, and all the wonders which human nature has to
suffer to produce, and enrich the manufacturers of Leeds,
Manchester, Birmingham, Li&egrave;ge, Roubaix, and the like in
turning out.&nbsp; So thus the situation briefly stood.</p>
<p><a name="page294"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 294</span>A
province, large and wealthy, the mouth of trade with the Sahara,
supposed to contain rich mines, though on this head nothing is
known with certainty, except that a little copper is worked near
Tarudant, though the natives say gold, silver, iron, and magnetic
ironstone exists; fertile in climate, thickly populated, and ill
affected to its ruler; fanatical and largely swayed by a sort of
general Witanegemot known as the &ldquo;Council of the
Forty,&rdquo; and yet the population bound to get all supplies of
European goods through the one port of Mogador.</p>
<p>Many and various have been the attempts to open trade
direct.&nbsp; Pirates and filibusters, and traders with a moral
sense of what was due to civilisation and to themselves, had all
attempted many times to supply the poor heathen with their
European trash, but never with success.&nbsp; Sometimes they
landed, were taken prisoners, and a &ldquo;diplomatic
question&rdquo; was superinduced until they were released.&nbsp;
At other times they disappeared on landing and were never heard
of, but still reports poured into Mogador of the great riches of
the Sus.&nbsp; These riches to my mind are non-existent, for I
have known hundreds of Susi traders, merchants, camel-drivers,
tribesmen, &ldquo;saints&rdquo; and acrobats, from Taserouelt,
but never saw a Susi who was rich.</p>
<p>In general, I found them tall, thin, dark-coloured men, very
intelligent, fanatical, great travellers, petty traders; now and
then ostrich hunters, and sometimes slave-dealers, but all were
poor, although when asked they always talked about gold-mines and
the riches of their land, and showed an evident desire that the
various ports along the coast should be left open for European
trade.</p>
<p>Then came the death, about four years ago, of the late Sultan
Mulai-el-Hassan (may God have pardoned him!), and the
disturbances consequent on the accession of a minor to the
throne.&nbsp; The Susis without doubt thought the time suitable
for movement, and no doubt hoped to be independent, and to buy
powder, tea, and sugar and cotton goods, without the trouble of
coming up to Mogador.&nbsp; Rebellions more or less partial took
place throughout the province, and were subdued.</p>
<p>About two years ago, in Mogador, appeared one Captain Geyling,
a Jewish Austrian subject, who, by some means or another, got
into communication with certain discontented chiefs, whom he
induced to sign a treaty with him to open up a port, start trade
with the interior, work the mines, and <a
name="page295"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 295</span>generally
to allow the country to be brought under the humanising influence
of European trade.&nbsp; This done, he straight repaired to
London, and tried to form a company, but found out, as Lydgate
did before him, that &ldquo;lacking money he mighte never
speede.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then came a hiatus, which perhaps some of the gentlemen who
planked their money down may like to fill up for the benefit of
those who take an interest in unofficial efforts to extend the
shadow of our flag.</p>
<p>We next find Captain Geyling back in Morocco, dressed in a
single-breasted black frock-coat and fez, and turned in the
interval into a pseudo-Turk under the title of Abdul Kerim
Bey.&nbsp; Here history says, as the advance agent of the Globe
Venture Syndicate he travelled like a prince, taking as many
tents as would befit a travelling menagerie, plate and more
plate, servants and horses, mules, guns, presents for the Kaids,
and impelled by a consuming thirst to get concessions for his
paymasters.&nbsp; With him as military adviser, attach&eacute;,
or what not, went Major Spilsbury, and why he let himself be
towed about the place by Geyling only he can tell.</p>
<p>Quiet but determined, a linguist, leader of men, and one of
those willing to risk his life ten times a day for any syndicate,
upon most reasonable terms, Spilsbury was a born
filibuster.&nbsp; Always about to make a fortune with schemes
innumerable, in which if you embarked you still stayed poor, or
became poorer; but with this difference from the schemes of most
men of his class, that he himself was never richer by a penny by
any one of them.&nbsp; Geyling had said he knew the Sultan well,
and as that potentate was somewhere in the south, Geyling
proceeded north and waited upon the Sherif of Wazan, the
spiritual head of all things in Morocco.&nbsp; There he seems not
to have had much luck, and then went east to Fez, back to the
coast, and after two or three months&rsquo; perambulation up and
down the land, went to Morocco city, where he ought to have gone
first.&nbsp; There neither Sultan nor Vizir would see him, and
with his tail between his legs, he returned to Mogador, and in a
little inn kept by a Jew quarrelled with Spilsbury, who, if
reports be true, threatened to beat him with a stirrup leather,
and the companionship broke up.&nbsp; Geyling Kerim went
homewards to Vienna, Novi Bazaar, or for all I know joined his
repatriated co-religionists in their new colony in
Palestine.&nbsp; But Spilsbury, being apparently determined to
play things out &ldquo;on a lone hand,&rdquo; remained in
Mogador, and <a name="page296"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
296</span>then embarked upon a series of adventures, the more
extraordinary when one remembers that he speaks no Arabic.</p>
<p>How, wherefore, in what manner, or by what means, he came
across him I do not know, but he fell in with an acquaintance of
my own, one Mr. Ratto, born in Mogador, and speaking Arabic, and
Shillah, French, English, Spanish and apparently all other
tongues with equal ease.&nbsp; What actually they did, only
themselves are in a position to record, but I suppose that,
taking advantage of the unsettled state of things, the
Sultan&rsquo;s absence punishing refractory tribes, and the
desire which every Arab chief has of getting arms to make himself
quite independent of all mankind, they must have entered into
negotiations with some of the chiefs of the wild tribes in
Sus.&nbsp; Spilsbury seems to have satisfied the Syndicate in
London that they could trade direct with Sus, receive concessions
from the chiefs, land and construct a factory, and in time make
themselves sole masters of the place.&nbsp; No doubt they
reasoned: If we are once established, when troubles come, England
must for her honour protect her subjects, and in protecting them,
protect their interests, and they knew that England once
committed to interference in any country (said to be rich), must
of necessity remain to restore order, introduce good government,
and generally to further the cause of progress and morality,
which is specially her aim in every country peopled by an
inferior race.&nbsp; What treaty Spilsbury took home is matter of
conjecture, but not unlikely he got signatures from chiefs, who
signed, thinking if all went well they would gain something, and
if things turned out badly they could say they had been deceived,
and signed a document that they had not understood.&nbsp; One
name is certain was appended to the deed, that of
M&rsquo;barek-ou-Ahmed, who is now securely chained in some
pestilential prison in Fez or Mequinez.&nbsp; Be all that as it
may, Spilsbury was shortly back again in Mogador, trying to hire
a vessel to convey himself, a Jew interpreter, and several
samples of his goods down to Akssis, a port between Wad Nun and
Agadhir.&nbsp; But by this time the Sultan had got wind of the
affair, and sent his emissaries into the Sus to bribe the chiefs
into allegiance, and what is more he had communicated with the
English Ambassador in Tangier, who having sent the news to
London, the expedition and its aim was laid before the Foreign
Office.&nbsp; Presently an official notice appeared declaring
that the British Government viewed with concern the meditated
attempt to open trade with a part of the Emperor of
Morocco&rsquo;s territory <a name="page297"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 297</span>against his will, and if any person
went for such a purpose, he must go at his own risk.&nbsp;
Spilsbury probably cared nothing for the protection or the
displeasure of either Government, so he pushed on his
preparations just as if nothing had occurred worth
mentioning.</p>
<p>The ukase of the British Government had made it difficult to
operate from Mogador, but Spilsbury, nothing dismayed, engaged a
Jew interpreter, and all alone, or at the most with two or three
companions, sailed for the Canaries, hired or bought a schooner,
and after a passage of an abnormal length, contending all the
time with contrary winds, sailed to Akssis, landed, and started
to palaver with the chiefs who were expecting him, with several
thousand men encamped upon the shore, having been warned most
probably by Mr. Ratto to hold themselves in readiness against his
coming.</p>
<p>Nothing more different than the inception of the Jameson
affair and that so boldly planned by Spilsbury.&nbsp; Both
gentlemen adventurers, or if you like, both advance agents of the
British Empire.&nbsp; One flagwagging and backed up by all the
&ldquo;fruit secs&rdquo; of the British army, champagne and
sandwiches laid on at every twenty miles upon the road; the other
almost alone upon a coast not visited twice in a century by
Europeans, and in the hands of men who kill a man with as few
compunctions as a settler up in North Queensland flogs a black to
death.&nbsp; If he had goods to sell I know not, if he had
samples of trade powder and trade guns, that is to me unknown,
but anyhow, by the assistance of his interpreter, he entered into
a council with certain of the chiefs, as the Sherif of
Taserouelt, the aforenamed M&rsquo;barek-ou-Ahmed, and others
whom it is better not to name, and was about to sign a treaty
with them, to open trade direct, put up a factory, work the
mines, and generally prepare the way before the faces of the
Globe Venture Syndicate.</p>
<p>But for an accident Spilsbury might have been Emperor of
Agadhir, the Lord Protector of the Sus, or Rajah of Tamagrut, but
Fate or the Sultan of Morocco had otherwise disposed.</p>
<p>Most of the chiefs of Sus were at Akssis with many of their
followers, but one Sheikh with about fifty horsemen had kept
aloof during the progress of the negotiations, either because he
had not been considered big enough to square, or as some think
because he was secretly acting under orders from the Moorish
Court.</p>
<p>Just as the chiefs were about to sign, and each one had <a
name="page298"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 298</span>agreed how
many rifles he was to receive on Spilsbury&rsquo;s return with a
well-laden ship, the Sheikh mounted his horse, marshalled his
followers and plunged into the middle of the crowd, yelling and
firing several shots, exclaiming: &ldquo;Out with the
Christians!&nbsp; I will not be a party to any dealings with our
hereditary foes.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thinking they were attacked in
force, the followers of the other chiefs returned the fire, all
was confusion, and Spilsbury, to save his life, had to retreat
precipitately on board his ship, and to complete the scene, the
smoke of a steamboat was seen coming down the coast.&nbsp; Now,
as no vessels between Agadhir and the Wad Nun come near the
coast, which is one of the most deserted in the world, Spilsbury
knew at once it must be a vessel of the Moorish Government upon
the search for him.&nbsp; Luckily night was near, and a fair wind
sprang up which took him to the Canaries, from whence he shipped
aboard a steamer and returned to England to plan another
trip.</p>
<p>What actually he did in England during the next six months I
do not know, but in November I met him at a London club, the
proud possessor of the steam yacht &ldquo;Tourmaline,&rdquo;
carrying a quick-firing gun, an assorted cargo of goods fit for
the Morocco trade, and some nine thousand rifles with which he
intended to arm his friends, the followers of Sidi Haschem, and
the other Sheikhs of Sus.&nbsp; The vessel lay at Greenhithe, and
was to sail next morning for Antwerp to take the rifles in; yet
Spilsbury sat smoking quietly without a trace of &ldquo;Union
Jackism,&rdquo; no word of &ldquo;moral purpose,&rdquo; not a
suggestion of being, as Dr. Jameson seemed to think he was, a
sort of John of Leyden going to set a people free.&nbsp; Simply
an ordinary club man, talking of what he was about to do, as he
had talked of fishing in Loch Tay.&nbsp; A well-dressed,
quiet-mannered filibuster, not bellowing that he would make the
Arabic language popular in Hell, after the &ldquo;fighting Bob
Tammany&rdquo; style, but quite aware that he was venturing his
life, and perilling for ever such reputation as he had.&nbsp; As
a law-abiding citizen, I tried to show him all the error of his
ways, spoke of the wickedness of all he was about to do, and
watched him get into a cab with mingled feelings of disgust at
the peddling syndicate which, for its wretched five per cent.,
was about to bring the name of England into contempt, and
admiration for the man who was going quietly to risk his life in
such a miserable cause.</p>
<p>How he sailed, reached Akssis, landed some rifles, was
interrupted in his dealings by the arrival on the one hand of <a
name="page299"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 299</span>the
Sultan&rsquo;s troops under Kaid el Giluli, and on the other by
the advent of the Moorish Government&rsquo;s armed transport,
&ldquo;El Hassani&rdquo;; how he exchanged shots with her,
rescued his boat, but failed to save his four companions who
remained captives; and how he with the yacht Tourmaline is still
detained, or was up to the other day, under surveillance in
Gibraltar, is well known to all.&nbsp; But what befel his four
companions and the unfortunate M&rsquo;barek-ou-Ahmed, his
intermediary, has never been made public in this country
yet.&nbsp; So, to make matters plain, I quote the letter of a
French Algerian gentleman settled in Mogador:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Vous me demandez des nouvelles de The Globe
Venture Cie, c&rsquo;est bien une aventure que les bondholders
Anglais ne goberont pas facilement.&nbsp; Vous savez que le
commandant en chef, Major Spilsbury, est arriv&eacute; &agrave;
Akssis entre Agadhir et Wad Nun, et l&agrave; il a
d&eacute;barque 500 fusils, 100 caisses cartouches, 4 balles
cotonnades, 25 caisses th&eacute;, etc.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Le Major a eu le bon esprit de rester &agrave; bord,
mais a fait d&eacute;barquer un jeune Anglais, le second du bord,
un allemand comptable, un Juif interpr&egrave;te, et un marin
portugais.&nbsp; Voil&agrave; un bouillabaisse!&nbsp; Enfin ils
se sont &eacute;tabli sous trois tentes sur la plage, avec le
Sheikh avec qui le Major avait fait connaissance chez M. Pepe
Ratto, et huit ou dix Arabes de l&rsquo;endroit.&nbsp;
Apr&egrave;s deux jours la fr&eacute;gate &lsquo;El
Hassani&rsquo; de sa Majest&eacute; Ch&eacute;rifienne est
arriv&eacute;e, en m&ecirc;me temps le Kaid El Giluli arrive par
terre avec 500 cavaliers, entoure les tentes et toute la boutique
est prise.&nbsp; Il y a eu quelque coups de fusils, deux hommes
du Major (Arabes) sont bless&eacute;s, la Tourmaline
s&rsquo;&eacute;loigna vers Lanzarote, les quatre
Europ&eacute;ens et le Juif sont pris, aussi que le chef Arabe
(M&rsquo;barek-ou-Ahmed) avec vingt de ses amis, et
l&rsquo;aventure est fini.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Les Arabes ont &eacute;t&eacute; conduit au Sultan qui
les a envoy&eacute; avec chaines se pourrir dans les prisons de
Fez, et les quatre Europ&eacute;ens sont depuis pr&egrave;s de
trois mois dans la maison du Kaid el Giluli &agrave; Ha-Ha, a
savourer la Shisha (vous en connaissez le gout oh Sheikh Mohamed
el Fasi), en attendant les ordres de Sidna. . . .&nbsp; Le pauvre
Sheikh, M&rsquo;barek-ou-Ahmed, n&rsquo;avait aucune influence
sur les tribus, et il ne marcha que sur la promesse que les
&lsquo;fregatas Inglise&rsquo; viendront d&eacute;barquer des
soldats anglais, le pays sera pris, on fera du Sheikh un Kaid, et
cela accompagn&eacute; de cent dollars, 20 livres de th&eacute;,
et un sac de sucre, et le pauvre Sheikh a eu l&rsquo;eau (et le
th&eacute;) a la bouche.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Un soldat qui avait conduit les prisonniers au Sultan,
a <a name="page300"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 300</span>dit,
que sur la route, le pauvre Sheikh disait tout le temps,
&lsquo;Oh, le Nazrani m&rsquo;a tromp&eacute;, ce sont des
trompeurs les chr&eacute;tiens, il m&rsquo;avait promis que des
fr&eacute;gates et des soldats anglais avec des canons
d&eacute;barqueront, et aux premier coup de fusil, son bateau
s&rsquo;est sauv&eacute;; par Dieu, ce chr&eacute;tien doit
&ecirc;tre un juif! mais c&rsquo;&eacute;tait &eacute;crit, Allah
Ackbar.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
